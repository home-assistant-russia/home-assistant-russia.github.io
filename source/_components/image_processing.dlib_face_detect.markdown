The `dlib_face_detect` image processing platform allows you to use the [Dlib](http://www.dlib.net/) through Home Assistant. This platform enables face detection from cameras, and can fire events with attributes.

This can be used to trigger an automation rule. Further info is on the [component](/components/image_processing/) page.
