The `nuheat` component lets you control connected floor heating thermostats from [NuHeat](http://www.nuheat.com/).

First, you will need to obtain your thermostat's numeric serial number or ID by logging into [MyNuHeat.com](https://mynuheat.com/) and selecting your thermostat(s).

Once you have the Thermostat ID(s), add the following information to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
nuheat:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
  devices: 12345

# Example configuration.yaml entry with multiple thermostats
nuheat:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
  devices:
    - 12345
    - 67890
```

{% configuration %}
