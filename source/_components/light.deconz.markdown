See the [deCONZ main component](/components/deconz/) for configuration instructions.

Entity Ids names will be light.device_name, where device_name is defined in deCONZ. Light groups created in deCONZ will be created in Home Assistant as lights named light.group_name_in_deconz, allowing the user to control groups of lights with only a single API call to deCONZ.
