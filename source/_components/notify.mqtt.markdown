The MQTT notification support is different than the other [notification](/components/notify/) platforms. It is a service. This means that you don't have to create a configuration entry but you need to provide more details when calling the service.

**Call Service** section from the **Developer Tools** allows you to send MQTT messages. Choose *mqtt/publish*  from the list of **Available services:** and enter something like the sample below into the **Service Data** field and hit **CALL SERVICE**.

```json
{"payload": "Test message from HA", "topic": "home/notification", "qos": 0, "retain": 0}
```

Using the [REST API](/developers/rest_api/#post-apiservicesltdomainltservice) to send a message to a given topic.

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H "x-ha-access: YOUR_PASSWORD" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"payload": "Test message from HA", "topic": "home/notification"}' \
