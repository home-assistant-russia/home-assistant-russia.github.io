This offers a map on the frontend to display the location of tracked devices. To set up tracked devices, look at the [device tracker](/components/device_tracker/) documentation.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
map:
```
<p class='note'>
Devices that are currently at home won't show on the map.
</p>
