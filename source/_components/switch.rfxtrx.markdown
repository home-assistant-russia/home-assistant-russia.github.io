The `rfxtrx` platform support switches that communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.

First you have to set up your [rfxtrx hub](/components/rfxtrx/).
The easiest way to find your switches is to add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  platform: rfxtrx
  automatic_add: True
```

Launch your Home Assistant and go the website.
Push your remote and your device should be added:

<p class='img'>
<img src='/images/components/rfxtrx/switch.png' />
</p>

Here the name is `0b11000102ef9f210010f70` and you can verify that it works from the frontend.
Then you should update your configuration to:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  platform: rfxtrx
  devices:
    0b11000102ef9f210010f70:
      name: device_name
```

Configuration variables:

- **devices** (*Required*): A list of devices with their name to use in the frontend.
- **automatic_add** (*Optional*): To enable the automatic addition of new switches.
- **signal_repetitions** (*Optional*): Because the RFXtrx device sends its actions via radio and from most receivers it's impossible to know if the signal was received or not. Therefore you can configure the switch to try to send each signal repeatedly.
- **fire_event** (*Optional*): Fires an event even if the state is the same as before, for example a doorbell switch. Can also be used for automations.

<p class='note warning'>
This component and the [rfxtrx binary sensor](/components/binary_sensor.rfxtrx/) can steal each other's devices when setting the `automatic_add` configuration parameter to `true`. Set `automatic_add` only when you have some devices to add to your installation, otherwise leave it to `False`.
</p>


Generate codes:

If you need to generate codes for switches you can use a template (useful for example COCO switches).

- Go to home-assistant-IP:8123/dev-template
- Use this code to generate a code:

```yaml
{% raw %}0b11000{{ range(100,700) | random | int }}bc0cfe0{{ range(0,10) | random | int }}010f70{% endraw %}
```

- Use this code to add a new switch in your configuration.yaml
- Launch your Home Assistant and go the website.
- Enable learning mode on your switch (i.e. push learn button or plug it in a wall socket)
- Toggle your new switch in the Home Assistant interface

Basic configuration with 3 devices:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  platform: rfxtrx
  automatic_add: False
  signal_repetitions: 2
  devices:
    0b1100ce3213c7f210010f70:
      name: Movment1
    0b11000a02ef2gf210010f50:
      name: Movment2
    0b1111e003af16aa10000060:
      name: Door
      fire_event: True
```

Light hallway if doorbell is pressed (when is sun down):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  platform: rfxtrx
  automatic_add: False
  devices:
    0710014c440f0160:
      name: Hall
    0710010244080780:
      name: Door
      fire_event: true
      
automation:
  - alias: Switch light on when door bell rings if sun is below horizon and light was off
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: button_pressed
      event_data: {"entity_id": "switch.door"}
    condition:
      condition: and
      conditions:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: sun.sun
          state: "below_horizon"
        - condition: state
          entity_id: switch.hall
          state: 'off'
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        entity_id: switch.hall
```

Use remote to enable scene (using event_data):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  platform: rfxtrx
  automatic_add: False
  devices:
    0b1100ce3213c7f210010f70:
      name: Light1
    0b11000a02ef2gf210010f50:
      name: Light2
    0b1111e003af16aa10000060:
      name: Keychain remote
      fire_event: true
scene:
  name: Livingroom
  entities:
    switch.light1: on
    switch.light2: on
    
automation:
  - alias: Use remote to enable scene
    trigger:
      platform: event
      event_type: button_pressed
      event_data: {"state": "on", "entity_id": "switch.keychain_remote"}
    action:
      service: scene.turn_on
      entity_id: scene.livingroom
```
