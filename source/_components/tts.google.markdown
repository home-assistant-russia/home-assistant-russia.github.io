The `google` text-to-speech platform uses [Google Text-to-Speech engine](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/speech.googleapis.com/overview) Text-to-Speech engine to read a text with natural sounding voices.

To enable text-to-speech with Google, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
tts:
  - platform: google
```

Configuration variables:

- **language** (*Optional*): The language to use. Defaults to `en`.
  - [Complete list of supported languages](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/languages).

A full configuration sample:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
tts:
  - platform: google
    language: 'de'
```

If you are using SSL certificate or Docker, you may need to add the `base_url` configuration variable to your `http` component as follows:

```yaml
#Example configuration.yaml entry
http:
  base_url: example.duckdns.org
```

The `base_url` configuration variable was added in 0.35.1, so make sure your Home Assistant version is **0.35.1 or above.**
