The `free_mobile` platform is using the French mobile operator [Free Mobile](http://mobile.free.fr/) to send SMS to your own cell phone. 

Before doing anything, you have to activate the SMS API option in your Free Mobile account (In "GÃ©rer mon compte -> Mes Options"). Activating this option will automatically generate a token which is required in your configuration.

</p>

This API only send classic SMS and only on the cell phone of the account owner. So you only have to provide a text message in your payload.

<p class='note warning'>
If you disable and re-enable the SMS API option, please be sure to update your token in your configuration.
</p>

To enable SMS notifications in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: free_mobile
    username: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
    access_token: TOKEN
```

Configuration variables:

- **username** (*Required*): This is the id given by FreeMobile to access to your online account.
- **access_token** (*Required*): You can get this token by activating the SMS API in your online account.
