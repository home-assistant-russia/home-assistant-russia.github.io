The `doorbird` implementation allows you to view the live video and previous images from your [DoorBird](http://www.doorbird.com/) device in Home Assistant.

<p class='note'>
  You must have the [DoorBird component](/components/doorbird/) configured to use this camera.
</p>

To enable the camera, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: doorbird
```
