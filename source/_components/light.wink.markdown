The `wink` light platform allows you to use your [Wink](http://www.wink.com/) lights.

The requirement is that you have setup [Wink](/components/wink/).


### {% linkable_title Supported light devices %}

- Z-wave switches with dimming
- Hue
- Lightify
- GE link
- Wink light groups (User created groups of lights)

<p class='note'>
The above devices are confirmed to work, but others may work as well.
