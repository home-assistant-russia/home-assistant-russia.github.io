The `mqtt` vacuum component allows you to control your MQTT-enabled vacuum.

To add your MQTT vacuum to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
vacuum:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "MQTT Vacuum"
    supported_features:
      - turn_on
      - turn_off
      - pause
      - stop
      - return_home
      - battery
      - status
      - locate
      - clean_spot
      - fan_speed
      - send_command
    command_topic: "vacuum/command"
    battery_level_topic: "vacuum/state"
    battery_level_template: "{{ value_json.battery_level }}"
    charging_topic: "vacuum/state"
    charging_template: "{{ value_json.charging }}"
    cleaning_topic: "vacuum/state"
    cleaning_template: "{{ value_json.cleaning }}"
    docked_topic: "vacuum/state"
    docked_template: "{{ value_json.docked }}"
    fan_speed_topic: "vacuum/state"
    fan_speed_template: "{{ value_json.fan_speed }}"
    set_fan_speed_topic: "vacuum/set_fan_speed"
    fan_speed_list:
      - min
      - medium
      - high
      - max
    send_command_topic: 'vacuum/send_command'
```

### {% linkable_title Default MQTT Protocol %}

The above configuration for this component expects an MQTT protocol like the following.

#### Basic Commands

MQTT topic: `vacuum/command`

Possible MQTT payloads:
- `turn_on` - Begin cleaning
- `turn_off` - Turn the Vacuum off
- `return_to_base` - Return to base/dock
- `stop` - Stop the Vacuum
- `clean_spot` - Initialize a spot cleaning cycle
- `locate` - Locate the vacuum (typically by playing a song)
- `start_pause` - Toggle the vacuum between cleaning and stopping

#### Set Fan Speed

MQTT topic: `vacuum/set_fan_speed`

Possible MQTT payloads:
- `min` - Minimum fan speed
- `medium` - Medium fan speed
- `high` - High fan speed
- `max` - Max fan speed

#### Send Custom Command

MQTT topic: `vacuum/send_command`

MQTT payload for `send_command` can be an arbitrary value handled by the vacuum's MQTT-enabled firmware.

#### Status/Sensor Updates

MQTT topic: `vacuum/state`

MQTT payload:
```json
{
    "battery_level": 61,
    "docked": true,
    "cleaning": false,
    "charging": true,
    "fan_speed": "off"
}
```
