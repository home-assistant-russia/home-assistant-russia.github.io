The `nest` platform allows you to watch the live stream of your [Nest](https://nest.com/camera/meet-nest-cam/) camera in Home Assistant.

<p class='note'>
You must have the [Nest component](/components/nest/) configured to use this camera.  The `nest` camera will automatically be setup when you do.
