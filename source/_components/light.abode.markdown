The `abode` security control panel platform allows you to control your [Abode](https://goabode.com/) alarms.

This component will automatically add `Lights` configured in your Abode account. You can reclassify `Switches` to show up within Home Assistant as lights by listing the Abode device ID in your [configuration](/components/abode/#configuration).

The requirement is that you have setup your [Abode hub](/components/abode/).
