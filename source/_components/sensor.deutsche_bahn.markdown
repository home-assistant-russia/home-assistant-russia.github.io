The `deutsche_bahn` sensor will give you the departure time of the next train for the given connection. In case of a delay, the delay is also shown. Additional details are used to inform about eg. the type of the train, price, and if it is on time.

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: deutsche_bahn
    from: NAME_OF_START_STATION
    to: NAME_OF_FINAL_STATION
```
{% configuration %}
from:
  description: The name of the start station.
  required: true
  type: string
to:
  description: The name of the end/destination station.
  required: true
  type: string
only_direct:
  description: Only show direct connections.
  required: false
  type: boolean
  default: false
{% endconfiguration %}

This sensor stores a lot of attributes which can be accessed by other sensors eg. a [template sensor](/components/sensor.template/).

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  platform: template
  sensors:
    next_departure:
      value_template: '{% raw %}{{ states.sensor.munich_to_ulm.attributes.next }}{% endraw %}'
      friendly_name: 'Next departure'
```

The data is coming from the [bahn.de](http://www.bahn.de/p/view/index.shtml) website.
