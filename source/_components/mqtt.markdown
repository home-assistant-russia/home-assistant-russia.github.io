MQTT (aka MQ Telemetry Transport) is a machine-to-machine or "Internet of Things" connectivity protocol on top of TCP/IP. It allows extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

Your first step to get MQTT and Home Assistant working is to choose a [broker](/docs/mqtt/broker).

To integrate MQTT into Home Assistant, add the following section to your `configuration.yaml` file. Keep in mind that the minimal setup will run with [an embedded MQTT broker](/docs/mqtt/broker#embedded-broker):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
```

To connect to your [own MQTT broker](/docs/mqtt/broker#run-your-own):

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  broker: IP_ADDRESS_BROKER
```
