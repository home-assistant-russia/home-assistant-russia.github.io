The `abode` security control panel platform allows you to control your [Abode](https://goabode.com/) alarms.

This component will automatically add `Power Switches` configured in your Abode account. You can reclassify switches to show up within Home Assistant as `Lights` by listing the Abode device ID in your [configuration](/components/abode/#configuration).

This component will also list all Abode `Automations` that are set up within the Abode system, allowing you to activate and deactivate the automations.

The requirement is that you have setup your [Abode hub](/components/abode/).
