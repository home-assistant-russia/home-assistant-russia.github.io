The 'hive' climate component integrates your Hive thermostat and hot water into Home Assistant, enabling control of setting the **mode** and setting the **target temperature**.
A short boost for Hive Heating or Hive Hot water can be set by using the **Aux Heat** function, this will turn on the boost feature for Hive Heating or Hive Hot water for 30 minutes at 0.5 degrees higher than the current temperature.

The Hive climate component supports the following Hive products:
- **Hive Active Heating**
- **Hive Multizone**
- **Hot water control**
