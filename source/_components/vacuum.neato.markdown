<p class='note'>
Starting with 0.57 the `neato` sensor was migrated to a vacuum platform.
</p>

The `neato` vacuum platform allows you to control your [Neato Botvac Connected](https://www.neatorobotics.com/robot-vacuum/botvac-connected-series/botvac-connected/).
The status will contain attributes on the robots last clean session.

To add `neato` sensors to your installation, follow instructions in [Neato component](/components/neato/).
