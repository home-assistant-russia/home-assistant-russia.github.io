<p class='note warning'>
  This sensor doesn't work at the moment due to changed by the [Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (Bundesamt für Umwelt - Abt. Hydrologie)](http://www.hydrodaten.admin.ch) to access the data.
</p>

The `swiss_hydrological_data` sensor will show you details (temperature, level, and discharge) of rivers and lakes in Switzerland.

The [station overview](http://www.hydrodaten.admin.ch/en/danger-levels-table.html) contains a list of all available measuring points and will help to determine the ID of station which is needed for the configuration.

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  platform: swiss_hydrological_data
  station: STATION_ID
```

Configuration variables:

- **name** (*Optional*): Name to use in the frontend.
- **station** (*Required*): The ID of the measurement point.

The hydrological measurings are coming from the [Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (Bundesamt für Umwelt - Abt. Hydrologie)](http://www.hydrodaten.admin.ch) and are updated almost in real-time.

This sensor contains additional information which an easily accessed by a [template sensor](/components/sensor.template/).

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  platform: template
  sensors:
    discharge:
      value_template: '{% raw %}{{ states.sensor.aare.attributes.Discharge }}{% endraw %}'
      friendly_name: 'Discharge'
```
