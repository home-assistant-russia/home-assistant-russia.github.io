The `emby` platform allows you to control a [Emby](http://emby.media/) multimedia system from Home Assistant.

To add Emby to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: emby
    host: 192.168.11.5
    api_key: "emby_api_key"
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Optional*): The host name or address of the device that is running Emby. Defaults to ```localhost```.
- **api_key** (*Required*): The api-key you would like home-assistant to use to authenticate.
- **ssl** (*Optional*): True if you want to connect with https/wss. Your SSL certificate must be valid. Default is False.
- **port** (*Optional*): The port number. Defaults to 8096 with SSL set to False and 8920 with SSL set to True.
- **auto_hide** (*Optional*): True if you want to automatically hide devices that are unavailable from the Home Assistant Interface. Defaults to False.
