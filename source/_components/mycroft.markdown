[Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai) is an open source voice assistant that allows you to send notifications and more to Mycroft from Home Assistant.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mycroft:
  host: 0.0.0.0
```

`host` is your IP address of your mycroft instance.  Once you have added your host to your `configuration.yaml` file, restart your Home Assistant server. This will load up the Mycroft component and make a service available to notify on Mycroft and more eventually.


The `mycroft` notification platform allows you to deliver notifications from Home Assistant to [Mycroft AI](https://mycroft.ai/).

To use this notification platform you simply need to input into the configuration that mycroft is your notification platform like seen above.


To use notifications, please see the [getting started with automation page](/getting-started/automation/).
