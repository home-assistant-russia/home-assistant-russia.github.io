The `zoneminder` sensor platform lets you monitor the current state of your [ZoneMinder](https://www.zoneminder.com) install including the number of events and the current state of the cameras.

<p class='note'>
You must have the [ZoneMinder component](/components/zoneminder/) configured to use this sensor.

  - **all**: All events.
