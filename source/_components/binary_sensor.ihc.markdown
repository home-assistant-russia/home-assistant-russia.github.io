Before you can use the IHC Binary Sensor platform, you must setup the [IHC Component](/components/ihc/)

When auto setup is enabled the following products will be found in the IHC project and setup as binary sensors:

* Dataline magnet contacts
* Dataline Pir sensors
* Dataline Pir sensors with twilight detection
* Dataline Pir alarm sensor
* Dataline smoke detector
* Dataline gas detector
* Dataline light sensor

To manually configure IHC Binary Sensors insert this section in your configuration:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: ihc
    binary_sensors:
      - id: 12345
        name: mysensor
        type: opening
        inverting: True
      - id: 12346
           ...
```

{% configuration %}
binary_sensors:
  description: List of binary sensors to setup manually.
  required: false
  type: map
  keys:
    id:
      description: The IHC resource id.
      required: true
      type: int
    inverting:
      description: If True the sensor will be inverted.
      required: false
      type: bool
      default: false
    name:
      description: The name of the component
      required: false
      type: string
    type:
      description: The binary sensor type. See [Home Assistant binary sensor](/components/binary_sensor/) for available types.
      required: false
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

The resource id should be an id of a boolean IHC resource.
For more information about IHC resource ids see [Manual Setup](/components/ihc/#manual-setup)
