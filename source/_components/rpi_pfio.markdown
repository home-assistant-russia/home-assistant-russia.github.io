The `rpi_pfio` component is the base for all related [PiFace Digital I/O (PFIO)](http://www.piface.org.uk/) platforms in Home Assistant. There is no setup needed for the component itself; for the platforms, please check their corresponding pages.

Set the jumpers on the PiFace board for address 0 (JP1: 1-2, JP2: 1-2).
