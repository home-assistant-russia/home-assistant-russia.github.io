Before you can use the IHC Switch platform, you must setup the [IHC Component](/components/ihc/)

When auto setup is enabled the following products will be found in the ihc project and setup as switch devices:

* Wireless plug outlet
* Wireless relay
* Mobile wireless relay
* Dataline plug outlet

To manually configure IHC switches insert this section in your configuration:

```yaml
switch:
    - platform: ihc
    auto_setup: True
    switches:
        - id: 12345
          name: myswitch
        - id: 12346
        ....
```

{% configuration %}
switches:
  description: List of switches to setup manually
  required: false
  type: map
  keys:
    id:
      description: The IHC resource id.
      required: true
      type: int
    name:
      description: The name of the component
      required: false
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

The resource id should be a boolean resource. (On/Off)
For more information about IHC resource ids see [Manual Setup](/components/ihc/#manual-setup)
