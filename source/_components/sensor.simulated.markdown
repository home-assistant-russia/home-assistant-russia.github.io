This component provides a simulated sensor that generates a time-varying signal ```V(t)``` given by the [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave):

 ```
 V(t) = M + A sin((2 pi (t - t_0) / w) + P) + N(s)
 ```

where:

- **M** = the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean) value of the sensor
- **A** = the [amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude) of the periodic contribution
- **t** = the time when a value is generated
- **t_0** = the time when the sensor is started
- **w** = the time [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function) in seconds for a single complete cycle of the periodic contribution
- **P** = the [phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_(waves)) offset to add to the periodic contribution, in units of degrees
- **N(s)** = the random [Gaussian noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_noise) with spread **s**

A simulated sensor with default values can be added to home-assistant using the following config:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: simulated
```

To give an example of simulating real world data, a simulated relative humidity sensor (in %) can be added using the following config:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: simulated
    name: 'simulated relative humidity'
    unit: '%'
    amplitude: 0 # Turns off the periodic contribution
    mean: 50
    spread: 10
    seed: 999
```
