The `mqtt` light platform lets you control your MQTT enabled lights. It supports setting brightness, color temperature, effects, flashing, on/off, RGB colors, transitions, XY colors and white values.

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with a `RETAIN` flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the switch will be `false` / `off`.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if the `state_topic` is available. Try to enable it, if experiencing incorrect light operation.

## {% linkable_title Examples %}

In this section you will find some real life examples of how to use this sensor.

### {% linkable_title Brightness and RGB support %}

To enable a light with brightness and RGB support in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Office Light RGB"
    state_topic: "office/rgb1/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/rgb1/light/switch"
    brightness_state_topic: "office/rgb1/brightness/status"
    brightness_command_topic: "office/rgb1/brightness/set"
    rgb_state_topic: "office/rgb1/rgb/status"
    rgb_command_topic: "office/rgb1/rgb/set"
    state_value_template: "{% raw %}{{ value_json.state }}{% endraw %}"
    brightness_value_template: "{% raw %}{{ value_json.brightness }}{% endraw %}"
    rgb_value_template: "{% raw %}{{ value_json.rgb | join(',') }}{% endraw %}"
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    optimistic: false
```

### {% linkable_title Brightness and no RGB support %}

To enable a light with brightness (no RGB version) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Office light"
    state_topic: "office/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/light/switch"
    brightness_state_topic: 'office/light/brightness'
    brightness_command_topic: 'office/light/brightness/set'
    qos: 0
    payload_on: "ON"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    optimistic: false
```

### {% linkable_title Brightness without on commands %}

To enable a light that sends only brightness topics to turn it on, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file. The `command_topic` is only used to send an off command in this case:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Brightness light"
    state_topic: "office/light/status"
    command_topic: "office/light/switch"
    payload_off: "OFF"
    brightness_state_topic: 'office/light/brightness'
    brightness_command_topic: 'office/light/brightness/set'
    on_command_type: 'brightness'
```


### {% linkable_title Implementations %}

- A [basic example](https://github.com/mertenats/open-home-automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_light) using a nodeMCU board (ESP8266) to control its built-in LED (on/off).
- Another [example](https://github.com/mertenats/open-home-automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_rgb_light) to control a RGB LED (on/off, brightness, and colors).
