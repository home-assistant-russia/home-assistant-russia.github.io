The `file` platform allows you to store notifications from Home Assistant as a file.

To enable file notifications in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: file
    filename: FILENAME
```

Configuration variables:

- **name** (*Optional*): Setting the optional parameter `name` allows multiple notifiers to be created. The default value is `notify`. The notifier will bind to the service `notify.NOTIFIER_NAME`.
- **filename** (*Required*): Name of the file to use. The file will be created if it doesn't exist and saved in your [configuration](/docs/configuration/) folder.
- **timestamp** (*Optional*): Setting `timestamp` to `True` adds a timestamp to every entry.

To use notifications, please see the [getting started with automation page](/getting-started/automation/).
