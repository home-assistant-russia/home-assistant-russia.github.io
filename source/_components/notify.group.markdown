The `group` notification platform allows you to combine multiple `notify` platforms into a single service.

To use this notification platform in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - name: NOTIFIER_NAME
    platform: group
    services:
      - service: html5
        data:
          target: "macbook"
      - service: html5_nexus
```

Configuration variables:

- **name** (*Required*): Setting the parameter `name` sets the name of the group.
- **services** (*Required*): A list of all the services to be included in the group.
  - **service** (*Required*): The service part of an entity ID, i.e. if you use `notify.html5` normally, just put `html5`. Note that you must put everything in lower case here. Although you might have capitals written in the actual notification services!
  - **data** (*Optional*): A dictionary containing parameters to add to all notify payloads. This can be anything that is valid to use in a payload, such as `data`, `message`, `target`, `title`.
