The `eight_sleep` component allows Home Assistant to fetch data from your [Eight Sleep](https://eightsleep.com/) smart cover or mattress.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

It's setup utilizing 'Sensor' components to convey the current state of your bed and results of your sleep sessions and a 'Binary Sensor' component to indicate your presence in the bed.  A service is also provided to set the heating level and duration of the bed.

You must have at least two sleep sessions recorded in the Eight Sleep app prior to setting up the Home Assistant component.

To get started add the following information to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
eight_sleep:
  username: YOUR_E_MAIL_ADDRESS
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
username:
  description: The email address associated with your Eight Sleep account.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: The password associated with your Eight Sleep account.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: Defines if you'd like to fetch data for both sides of the bed.

{% endconfiguration %}
