The `thethingsnetwork` sensor platform allows you to get data from a [The Things Network Storage Integration](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/storage/).

This platform requires that the [The Things Network component](/components/thethingsnetwork/) is set up and the [The Things Network Storage Integration](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/storage/) as well.

Visit the [The Things Network Console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/) website, log in with your The Things Network credentials, choose your application from **Applications** and go to **Integrations**.

Add a new integration.

To enable this platform, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: thethingsnetwork
    device_id: ha-demo
    values:
      sensor_value: unit of measurement
      voltage: V
```

{% configuration %}
  device_id:
    description: The ID of the device.
    required: true
    type: string
  values:
    description: The sensor values with their unit of measurement
    required: true
    type: list
{% endconfiguration %}
