The `splunk` component makes it possible to log all state changes to an external [Splunk](http://splunk.com/) database using Splunk's HTTP Event Collector (HEC) feature. You can either use this alone, or with the Home Assistant for Splunk [app](https://github.com/miniconfig/splunk-homeassistant). Since the HEC feature is new to Splunk, you will need to use at least version 6.3.

To use the `splunk` component in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
splunk:
  token: B4415DFF-683C-5C6C-3994-4F6D4A5DB03A
```

Configuration variables:

- **token** (*Required*): The HTTP Event Collector Token already created in your Splunk instance.
- **host** (*Optional*): IP address or host name of your Splunk host, eg. 192.168.1.10. Will default to `localhost` if not supplied.
- **port** (*Optional*): Port to use. Defaults to 8088.
- **ssl** (*Optional*): Use https instead of http to connect. Defaults to False.
- **name** (*Optional*): This parameter allows you to specify a friendly to send to Splunk as the host, instead of using the name of the HEC. Defaults to HASS
