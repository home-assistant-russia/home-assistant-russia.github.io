The `enocean` sensor platform currently only allows reading out the power measured in a Permundo PSC234 switch.

To use your EnOcean device, you first have to set up your [EnOcean hub](../enocean) and then add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - name: Television
    platform: enocean
    id: [0x01,0x90,0x84,0x3C]
```

Configuration variables:

- **id** (*Required*): The ID of the device. This is a 4 bytes long number.
- **platform** (*Required*): Set to `enocean`.
- **name** (*Required*): An identifier for the switch
