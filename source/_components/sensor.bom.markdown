The `bom` sensor platform uses the [Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)](http://www.bom.gov.au) as a source for current (half-hourly) meteorological data.

- Each sensor will be given the `device_id` of "bom [optionalname] friendlyname units"
- A name is optional but if multiple BOM weather stations are used a name will be required.
- The sensor checks for new data every minute, starting 30 minutes after the timestamp of the most recent data as the data is updated every half-hour.

To add the BOM weather observation to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: bom
    station: IDS60801.94675
    name: Adelaide
    monitored_conditions:
      - apparent_t
      - cloud
      - cloud_base_m
      - cloud_oktas
      - cloud_type_id
      - cloud_type
      - delta_t
      - gust_kmh
      - gust_kt
      - air_temp
      - dewpt
      - press
      - press_qnh
      - press_msl
      - press_tend
      - rain_trace
      - rel_hum
      - sea_state
      - swell_dir_worded
      - swell_height
      - swell_period
      - vis_km
      - weather
      - wind_dir
      - wind_spd_kmh
      - wind_spd_kt
```

To get the station ID for any BOM station:
- Find your station on these maps: [NSW](http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/observations/map.shtml), [QLD](http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/observations/map.shtml), [VIC](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/observations/map.shtml), [WA](http://www.bom.gov.au/wa/observations/map.shtml), [SA](http://www.bom.gov.au/sa/observations/map.shtml), [TAS](http://www.bom.gov.au/tas/observations/map.shtml), [ACT](http://www.bom.gov.au/act/observations/canberramap.shtml), [NT](http://www.bom.gov.au/nt/observations/map.shtml).
 - alternatively, from the [BOM website](http://www.bom.gov.au/), navigate to State -> Observations -> Latest Observations -> Choose the station.
- The URL will look like: http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDx60801/[station].shtml
 - For Adelaide, the URL will look like `http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDS60801/IDS60801.94675.shtml`; the station ID is `IDS60801.94675`.

Configuration variables:

- **station** (*Optional*): The station ID string as identified from the BOM website.  If not given, defaults to the closest station.
- **name** (*Optional*): The name you would like to give to the weather station.
- **monitored_conditions** (*Required*): A list of the conditions to monitor.

<p class='note'>
This sensor is an alternative to the [`bom`](/components/weather.bom/) weather platform.
The weather platform is easier to configure but less customisable.
