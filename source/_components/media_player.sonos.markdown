The `sonos` platform allows you to control your [Sonos](http://www.sonos.com) HiFi wireless speakers and audio components from Home Assistant. By default it supports auto-discovery provided by Home Assistant, and you don't need to add anything to your `configuration.yaml`. Alternatively, there are some manual configuration options, listed as follows:

To add your Sonos components to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file.  It will perform Sonos auto-discovery of your connected speakers.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry using Sonos discovery
media_player:
  - platform: sonos
```


If you have multiple network devices, you can provide the IP address of the device that should be used for Sonos auto-discovery.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry using Sonos discovery on a specific interface
media_player:
  - platform: sonos
    interface_addr: 192.0.2.1
```

You can also specify one or more hosts to connect to if they cannot be found with Sonos auto-discovery.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry with manually specified addresses
media_player:
  - platform: sonos
    hosts: 192.0.2.25
```

or, for multiple hosts:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry with manually specified addresses
media_player:
  - platform: sonos
    hosts:
      - 192.0.2.25
      - 192.0.2.26
      - 192.0.2.27
```
