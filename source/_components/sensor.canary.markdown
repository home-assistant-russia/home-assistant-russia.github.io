The `canary` sensor platform allows you to integrate the sensors of your [Canary](https://canary.is) devices in Home Assistant.

To add `canary` sensors to your installation, follow instructions in [Canary component](/components/canary/).

Once loaded, you will see following sensors:

* A sensor per camera that reports temperature.
* A sensor per camera that reports humidity.
* A sensor per camera that reports air quality.
