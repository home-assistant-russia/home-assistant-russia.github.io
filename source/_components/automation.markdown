Please see the [docs section](/docs/automation/) for in-depth documentation on how to use the automation component.

Starting with 0.28 your automation rules can be controlled with the frontend.

This allows one to reload the automation without restarting Home Assistant itself. If you don't want to see the automation rule in your frontend use `hide_entity: True` to hide it. You can also use `initial_state: 'off'` so that the automation is not automatically turned on after a Home Assistant reboot.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Door alarm
    hide_entity: True
    initial_state: 'off'
    trigger:
      - platform: state
  ...
```
