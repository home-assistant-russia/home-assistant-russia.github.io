The `skybell` implementation allows you to integrate your [Skybell.com](http://www.skybell.com/) doorbells in Home Assistant.

Currently only the Skybell HD is supported by this platform.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To enable devices set up with your [Skybell.com](http://www.skybell.com/) account, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
skybell:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
username:
  description: The username for accessing your Skybell account.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: The password for accessing your Skybell account.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

Finish your configuration by visiting the [Skybell binary sensor](/components/binary_sensor.skybell/), [Skybell camera](/components/camera.skybell/), [Skybell light](/components/light.skybell/), [Skybell sensor](/components/sensor.skybell/), or [Skybell switch](/components/switch.skybell/) documentation.
