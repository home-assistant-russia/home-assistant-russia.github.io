The ComEd Hourly Pricing program is an optional program available to ComEd electric subscribers which charges customers a variable rate for electricity supply based on current demand rather than a traditional fixed rate. Live prices are published [here](https://hourlypricing.comed.com/live-prices/) and also via an [API](https://hourlypricing.comed.com/hp-api/) which we can integrate as a sensor in Home Assistant.

There are two price feeds available: the 5-minute price and current hour average price.

To use this sensor in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: comed_hourly_pricing
    monitored_feeds:
      - type: five_minute
      - type: current_hour_average
```

Configuration variables:

- **monitored_feeds** array (*Required*): Feeds to monitor.
  - **type** (*Required*): Name of the feed.
      - **five_minute**: The latest 5-minute price in cents.
      - **current_hour_average**: The latest current hour average price in cents.
  - **name** (*Optional*): Custom name for the sensor.
  - **offset** (*Optional*): The pricing feeds provide only the *supply* cost of the electricity. The offset parameter allows you to provide a fixed constant that will be added to the pricing data to provide a more accurate representation of the total electricity cost per kWh.
