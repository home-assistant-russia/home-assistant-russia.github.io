The `thinkingcleaner` sensor platform simple displays information about your [Thinking Cleaner](http://www.thinkingcleaner.com) add-on.

To enable this sensor in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: thinkingcleaner
```

This will automatically add sensors for each Thinking Cleaner in your network.
