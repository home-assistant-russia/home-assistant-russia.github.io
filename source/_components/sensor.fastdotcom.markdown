The `fastdotcom` sensor component uses the [Fast.com](https://fast.com/) web service to measure network bandwidth performance.

<p class='note'>
Currently fast.com only supports measuring download bandwidth. If you want to measure bandwidth metrics other then download such as ping and upload, utilize the [speedtest](/components/sensor.speedtest) component.
</p>

By default, it will run every hour.  The user can change the update frequency in the config by defining the minute, hour, and day for a speedtest to run.

To add a Fast.com sensor to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

Once per hour, on the hour (default):

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: fastdotcom 
```

More examples:

Every half hour of every day:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: fastdotcom
    minute:
      - 0
      - 30
```
Configuration variables:

- **minute** (*Optional*): Specify the minute(s) of the hour to schedule the speedtest. Use a list for multiple entries. Default is 0.
- **hour** (*Optional*): Specify the hour(s) of the day to schedule the speedtest. Use a list for multiple entries. Default is None.
- **day** (*Optional*): Specify the day(s) of the month to schedule the speedtest. Use a list for multiple entries. Default is None.
- **manual** (*Optional*): True or False to turn manual mode on or off.  Manual mode will disable scheduled speedtests.

There is also a service named `sensor.update_fastdotcom` that you can use to run a fast.com speedtest on demand.  You can turn on manual mode to disable the scheduled speedtests.
