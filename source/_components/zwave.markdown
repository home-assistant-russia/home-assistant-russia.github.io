The [Z-Wave](http://www.z-wave.com/) integration for Home Assistant allows you to observe and control connected Z-Wave devices. Please see the [Z-Wave getting started section](/docs/z-wave/) for in-depth documentation on how to use and setup the Z-Wave component.

If you have setup the requirements, then add the following entry `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
