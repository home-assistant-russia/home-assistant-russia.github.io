The `input_text` component allows the user to define values that can be controlled via the frontend and can be used within conditions of automation. Changes to the value stored in the text box generate state events. These state events can be utilized as `automation` triggers as well. It can also be configured in password mode (obscured text).

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entries
input_text:
  text1:
    name: Text 1
    initial: Some Text
  text2:
    name: Text 2
    min: 8
    max: 40
  text3:
    name: Text 3
    pattern: '[a-fA-F0-9]*'
  text4:
    name: Text 4
    mode: password
```

{% configuration %}
  input_text:
    description: Alias for the input. Multiple entries are allowed.
    required: true
    type: map
    keys:
      name:
        description: Friendly name of the text input.
        required: false
        type: String
      min:
        description: Minimum length for the text value.
        required: false
        type: int
        default: 0
      max:
        description: Maximum length for the text value.
        required: false
        type: int
        default: 100
      initial:
        description: Initial value when Home Assistant starts.
        required: false
        type: String
        default: empty
      pattern:
        description: Regex pattern for client side validation.
        required: false
        type: String
        default: empty
      mode:
        description: Can specify `text` or `password`. Elements of type "password" provide a way for the user to securely enter a value.
        required: false
        type: String
        default: text
{% endconfiguration %}

### {% linkable_title Restore State %}

This component supports the `restore_state` function which restores the state after Home Assistant has started to the value it has been before Home Assistant stopped. To use this feature please make sure that the [`recorder`](/components/recorder/) component is enabled and your entity does not have a value set for `initial`. Additional information can be found in the [Restore state](/components/recorder/#restore-state) section of the [`recorder`](/components/recorder/) component documentation.
