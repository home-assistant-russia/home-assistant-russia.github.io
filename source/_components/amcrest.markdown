The `amcrest` camera platform allows you to integrate your [Amcrest](https://amcrest.com/) IP camera in Home Assistant.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To enable your camera in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
amcrest:
  - host: IP_ADDRESS_CAMERA_1
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
    sensors:
      - motion_detector
      - sdcard
    switches:
      - motion_detection
      - motion_recording

 - host: IP_ADDRESS_CAMERA_2
   username: YOUR_USERNAME
   password: YOUR_PASSWORD
   resolution: low
   stream_source: snapshot
   sensors:
     - ptz_preset
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): The IP address or hostname of your camera. If using a hostname, make sure the DNS works as expected.
- **username** (*Required*): The username for accessing your camera.
- **password** (*Required*): The password for accessing your camera.
- **name** (*Optional*): This parameter allows you to override the name of your camera. The default is "Amcrest Camera".
- **port** (*Optional*): The port that the camera is running on. The default is 80.
- **resolution** (*Optional*): This parameter allows you to specify the camera resolution. For a high resolution (1080/720p), specify the option `high`. For VGA resolution (640x480p), specify the option `low`. If omitted, it defaults to *high*.
- **stream_source** (*Optional*): The data source for the live stream. `mjpeg` will use the camera's native MJPEG stream, whereas `snapshot` will use the camera's snapshot API to create a stream from still images. You can also set the `rtsp` option to generate the streaming via RTSP protocol. If omitted, it defaults to *snapshot*.
- **ffmpeg_arguments**: (*Optional*): Extra options to pass to ffmpeg, e.g., image quality or video filter options.
- **authentication**: (*Optional*): Defines which authentication method to use only when **stream_source** is **mjpeg**. Currently, *aiohttp* only support *basic*. It defaults to *basic*.
- **scan_interval** (*Optional*): Defines the update interval of the sensor in seconds. The default is 10 seconds.
- **sensors** array (*Optional*): Conditions to display in the frontend. By default, *none* of the conditions are enabled. The following conditions can be monitored.
  - **motion_detector**: Return True/False when a motion is detected
  - **sdcard**: Return the SD card usage by reporting the total and used space
  - **ptz_preset**: Return the number of PTZ preset positions configured for the given camera
- **switches** array (*Optional*): Switches to display in the frontend. By default, *none* of the switches are shown. The following switches can be monitored.
  - **motion_detection**: Enable/disable motion detection setting 
  - **motion_recording**: Enable/disable recording on motion detection setting

**Note:** Amcrest cameras with newer firmware no longer have the ability to stream `high` definition video with MJPEG encoding. You may need to use `low` resolution stream or the `snapshot` stream source instead.  If the quality seems too poor, lower the `Frame Rate (FPS)` and max out the `Bit Rate` settings in your camera's configuration manager. If you defined the *stream_source* to **mjpeg**, make sure your camera supports *Basic* HTTP authentication. Newer Amcrest firmware may not work, then **rtsp** is recommended instead.

**Note:** If you set the `stream_source` option to `rtsp`, make sure to follow the steps mentioned at
[FFMPEG](/components/ffmpeg/) documentation to install the `ffmpeg`.

Finish its configuration by visiting the [Amcrest sensor page](/components/sensor.amcrest/) or [Amcrest camera page](/components/camera.amcrest/).

To check if your Amcrest camera is supported/tested, visit the [supportability matrix](https://github.com/tchellomello/python-amcrest#supportability-matrix) link from the `python-amcrest` project.
