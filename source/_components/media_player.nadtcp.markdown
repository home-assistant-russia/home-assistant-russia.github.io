The `nadtcp` platform allows you to control the D7050 and C338 from Home Assistant via WiFi. Note that it has only been tested with the D 7050.

To add a NAD amplifier to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
    platform: nadtcp
    host: 192.168.0.112
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): The IP address of your amplifier.
- **name** (*Optional*): Name of the device. Default is NAD amplifier.
- **min_volume** (*optional*): Minimum volume in dB to use with the slider. Default is `-60`
- **max_volume** (*optional*): Maximum volume in dB to use with the slider. Default is `-10`
- **volume_step** (*Optional*): The amount in dB you want to increase the volume with when pressing volume up/down. Default is 4 dB.

The maximum volume level of the D 7050 amplifier is +10 db, minimum is -90.
