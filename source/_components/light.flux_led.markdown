The `flux_led` support is integrated into Home Assistant as a light platform. Several brands of both bulbs and controllers use the same protocol and they have the HF-LPB100 chipset in common. The chances are high that your bulb or controller (eg. WiFi LED CONTROLLER) will work if you can control the device with the MagicHome app.

Example of bulbs:

- [Flux Smart Lighting](http://www.fluxsmartlighting.com/)
- [MagicLightÂ® Plus - WiFi Smart LED Light Bulb4](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NOC93NG)
- [Flux WiFi Smart LED Light Bulb4](http://smile.amazon.com/Flux-WiFi-Smart-Light-Bulb/dp/B01A6GHHTE)
- [WIFI smart LED light Bulb1](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CS1EZYK)

Examples of controllers:

- [Ledenet WiFi RGBW Controller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DY56N8U)
- [SUPERNIGHT WiFi Wireless LED Smart Controller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JZ2SI6Q)


### {% linkable_title Configuration Details %}


To enable those lights, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: flux_led
```

Configuration variables:

- **automatic_add** (*Optional*): To enable the automatic addition of lights on startup.
- **devices** (*Optional*): A list of devices with their ip address

Configuration variables within devices list:

- **name**  (*Optional*): A friendly name for the device.
- **mode**  (*Optional*): The chosen brightness mode; options are 'rgbw' and 'rgb', defaults to rgbw.
- **protocol**  (*Optional*): Set this to 'ledenet' if you are using a ledenet bulb.


<p class='note'>
Depending on your controller or bulb type, there are two ways to configure brightness. 
The component defaults to rgbw. If your device has a separate white channel, you do not need to specify anything else; changing the white value will adjust the brightness of white channel keeping rgb color constant. However, if your device does not have a separate white channel, you will need to set the mode to rgb. In this mode, the device will keep the same color, and adjust the rgb values to dim or brighten the color.

### {% linkable_title Example configuration %}

Will automatically search and add all lights on start up:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: flux_led
    automatic_add: True
```

Will add two lights with given name and create an automation rule to randomly set color each 45 seconds:

```yaml
light:
# Example configuration.yaml entry
  - platform: flux_led
    devices:
      192.168.0.106:
        name: flux_lamppost
      192.168.0.109:
        name: flux_living_room_lamp

automation:
  alias: random_flux_living_room_lamp
  trigger:
    platform: time
    seconds: '/45'
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    data:
      entity_id: light.flux_living_room_lamp
      effect: random
```

Will add a light without the white mode:

```yaml
    192.168.1.10:
      name: NAME
      mode: "rgb"
```

Will add a light with rgb+white mode (default). White and RGB channels can be adjusted independently using a slider and color picker respectively.

```yaml
    192.168.1.10:
      name: NAME
      mode: "rgbw"
```

Some devices such as the Ledenet RGBW controller use a slightly different protocol for communicating the brightness to each color channel. If your device is only turning on or off but not changing color or brightness try adding the LEDENET protocol.

```yaml
light:
  - platform: flux_led
    devices:
      192.168.1.10:
        name: NAME
        protocol: 'ledenet'
```

### {% linkable_title Effects %}

The FLUX_LED light offers a number of effects which are not included in other lighting packages. These can be selected from the front-end, or sent in the effect field of the light TURN_ON command.
