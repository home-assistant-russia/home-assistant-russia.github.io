The `insteon_local` switch component lets you control your switches connected to an [Insteon Hub](http://www.insteon.com/insteon-hub/) with Home Assistant.

To get your insteon switches working with Home Assistant, follow the instructions for the general [Insteon local component](/components/insteon_local/). The switches will be automatically disovered and added to Home Assistant. The device names will be the Insteon address of the switch.
