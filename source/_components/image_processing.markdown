Image processing enables Home Assistant to process images from [cameras](/components/#camera). Only camera entities are supported as sources.

For interval control, use `scan_interval` in platform.

<p class='note'>
If you are running Home Assistant over SSL or from within a container, you will have to setup a base URL (`base_url`) inside the [http component](/components/http/).
