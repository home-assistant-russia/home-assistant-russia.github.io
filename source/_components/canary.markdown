The `canary` component allows you to integrate your [Canary](https://canary.is) devices in Home Assistant.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

You will need your Canary login information (username, usually your email address, and password) to use this module.

To set it up, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
canary:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
  username:
    description: The username for accessing your Canary account.
    required: true
    type: string
  password:
    description: The password for accessing your Canary account.
    required: true
    type: string
  timeout:
    description: Timeout to wait for connections.
    required: false
    type: int
    default: 10
{% endconfiguration %}

Once loaded, your front end will have the following components:

* A camera image triggered by motion for each camera.
* An alarm control panel for each location.
* A sensor per camera that reports temperature.
* A sensor per camera that reports humidity.
* A sensor per camera that reports air quality.
