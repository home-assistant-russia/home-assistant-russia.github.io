The `spc` platform allows you to get data from your [Vanderbilt SPC](http://www.spc-intruder-detection.com/ssp-spc/) binary sensors from within Home Assistant. 

Check the [type/class](/components/binary_sensor/) list for a possible visualization of your zone. Currently motion, smoke and door sensors are supported.
  
The requirement is that you have setup your [SPC hub](/components/spc/).
