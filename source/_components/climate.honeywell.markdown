To set it up, add the following information to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: honeywell
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
    scan_interval: 600
```
<p class='note'>
Scan interval is expressed in seconds. Omitting scan_interval may result in too-frequent polling and cause you to rate-limited by Honeywell.
