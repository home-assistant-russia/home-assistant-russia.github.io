To get your [Arlo](https://arlo.netgear.com/) cameras working within Home Assistant, please follow the instructions for the general [Arlo component](/components/arlo).

This component is not yet able to live stream from your Arlo camera, but it will be able to playback the last video capture.

Once you have enabled the [Arlo component](/components/arlo), add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
camera:
  - platform: arlo
    ffmpeg_arguments: '-pred 1 -q:v 2'
```

Configuration variables:

- **ffmpeg_arguments**: (*Optional*): Extra options to pass to ffmpeg, e.g., image quality or video filter options.

**Note:** To be able to playback the last capture, it is required to install the `ffmpeg` component. Make sure to follow the steps mentioned at [FFMPEG](/components/ffmpeg/) documentation.
