The [Snips Voice Platform](https://www.snips.ai) allows users to add powerful voice assistants to their Raspberry Pi devices without compromising on privacy. It runs 100% on-device, and does not require an internet connection. It features Hotword Detection, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Dialog Management.

The latest documentation can be found here: [Snips Platform Documentation](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki).

![Snips Modules](/images/screenshots/snips_modules.png)

Snips takes voice or text as input and produces *intents* as output, which are explicit representations of an intention behind an utterance and which can subsequently be used by Home Assistant to perform appropriate actions.

## {% linkable_title The Snips Voice Platform %}

### {% linkable_title Installation %}

The Snips platform can be installed via the Snips APT/Debian repository. If you prefer to install the platform using the Docker distribution, check out our [Docker Installation Guide](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/6.--Miscellaneous#using-docker).

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y dirmngr
$ sudo bash -c  'echo "deb https://raspbian.snips.ai/$(lsb_release -cs) stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/snips.list'
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys D4F50CDCA10A2849
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y snips-platform-voice
```

Note: if the keyserver pgp.mit.edu is down try to use another one in the 4th line , like pgp.surfnet.nl:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.surfnet.nl --recv-keys D4F50CDCA10A2849
```

### {% linkable_title Creating an assistant %}

</div>

Head over to the [Snips Console](https://console.snips.ai) to create your assistant. Launch the training and download by clicking on the "Download Assistant" button.

The next step is to get the assistant to work on your device. Unzip and copy the assistant folder that you downloaded from the web console to the path. Assuming your downloaded assistant folder is on your desktop, just run:

```bash
$ scp -r ~/Desktop/assistant pi@<raspi_hostname.local_or_IP>:/home/pi/.
```

Now ssh into your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
$ ssh pi@<raspi_hostname.local_or_IP>
```

By default, this command is `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`, if you are using the default Raspberry Pi hostname.

Then, move the assistant to the right folder:

```bash
(pi) $ sudo mv /home/pi/assistant /usr/share/snips/assistant
```

Note: if you already have an assistant installed and wish to replace it, start by removing the previous one, and then move the new one in its place:

```bash
(pi) $ sudo rm -r /usr/share/snips/assistant
(pi) $ sudo mv /home/pi/assistant /usr/share/snips/assistant
```

### {% linkable_title Running Snips %}

Make sure that a microphone is plugged to the Raspberry Pi. If you are having trouble setting up audio, we have written a guide on [Raspberry Pi Audio Configuration](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/1.-Setup-the-Snips-Voice-Platform-on-your-Raspberry-Pi#configuring-the-audio).

Start the Snips Voice Platform by starting the `snips-*` services:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start "snips-*"
```

Snips is now ready to take voice commands from the microphone. To trigger the listening, simply say

> Hey Snips

followed by a command, e.g.

> Set the lights to green in the living room

As the Snips Platform parses this query into an intent, it will be published on MQTT, on the `hermes/intent/<intentName>` topic. The Snips Home Assistant component subscribes to this topic, and handles the intent according to the rules defined in `configuration.yaml`, as explained below.

#### {% linkable_title Optional: specifying an external MQTT broker %}

By default, Snips runs its own MQTT broker. But we can also tell Snips to use an external broker by specifying this when launching Snips. In this case, we need to specify this in the `/etc/snips.toml` configuration file. For more information on configuring this, see the [Using an external MQTT broker](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-platform-documentation/wiki/6.--Miscellaneous#using-external-mqtt-broker) article.

## {% linkable_title Home Assistant configuration %}

### {% linkable_title Specifying the MQTT broker %}

Messages between Snips and Home Assistant are passed via MQTT. We can either point Snips to the MQTT broker used by Home Assistant, as explained above, or tell Home Assistant which [MQTT broker](/docs/mqtt/) to use by adding the following entry to the `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: MQTT_BROKER_IP
  port: MQTT_BROKER_PORT
```

By default, Snips runs an MQTT broker on port 9898. So if we wish to use this broker, and if Snips and Home Assistant run on the same device, the entry will look as follows:

```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: 127.0.0.1
  port: 9898
```

Alternatively, MQTT can be configured to bridge messages between servers if using a custom MQTT broker such as [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/).

### {% linkable_title Triggering actions %}

In Home Assistant, we trigger actions based on intents produced by Snips using the [`intent_script`](/components/intent_script) component. For instance, the following block handles a `ActivateLightColor` intent to change light colors:

{% raw %}
```yaml
snips:

intent_script:
  ActivateLightColor:
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        data_template:
          entity_id: light.{{ objectLocation | replace(" ","_") }}
          color_name: {{ objectColor }}
```
{% endraw %}

In the `data_template` block, we have access to special variables, corresponding to the slot names for the intent. In the present case, the `ActivateLightColor` has two slots, `objectLocation` and `objectColor`.

### {% linkable_title Special slots %}

In the above example, the slots are plain strings. However, when more complex types are used, such as dates or time ranges, they will be transformed to rich Python objects, for example:

{% raw %}
```yaml
SetTimer:
  speech:
    type: plain
    text: weather
  action:
    service: script.set_timer
    data_template:
      name: "{{ timer_name }}"
      duration: "{{ timer_duration }}"
      seconds: "{{ slots.timer_duration.value.seconds }}"
      minutes: "{{ slots.timer_duration.value.minutes }}"
      hours: "{{ slots.timer_duration.value.hours }}"
```
{% endraw %}

### Sending TTS Notifications

You can send TTS notifications to Snips using the snips.say and snips.say_action services. Say_action starts a session and waits for user response, "Would you like me to close the garage door?", "Yes, close the garage door".

#### {% linkable_title Service `snips/say` %}

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                            |
|------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `text`                 |       no | Text to say.                                           |
| `site_id`              |      yes | Site to use to start session.                          |
| `custom_data`          |      yes | custom data that will be included with all messages in this session. |

#### {% linkable_title Service `snips/say_action` %}

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description                                            |
|------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `text`                 |       no | Text to say.                                           |
| `site_id`              |      yes | Site to use to start session.                          |
| `custom_data`          |      yes | custom data that will be included with all messages in this session. |
| `can_be_enqueued`      |      yes | If True, session waits for an open session to end, if False session is dropped if one is running. |
| `intent_filter`        |      yes | Array of Strings - A list of intents names to restrict the NLU resolution to on the first query. |

#### Configuration Examples

  turn_on_light:
    sequence:
      service: script.turn_on_light
      service: snips.say
        data:
          text: 'OK, the light is now on'

automation:

          intentFilter:
            - closeGarageDoor

# This intent is fired if the user responds with the appropriate intent after the above notification
intent_script:
  closeGarageDoor:
    speech:
      type: plain
      text: 'OK, closing the garage door'
    action:
