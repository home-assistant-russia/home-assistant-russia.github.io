  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: click
    event_data:
      entity_id: binary_sensor.switch_158d000xxxxxc2
      click_type: long_click_press
  action:
    service: xiaomi_aqara.play_ringtone
    data:
      gw_mac: xxxxxxxxxxxx
      ringtone_id: 8
      ringtone_vol: 8

- alias: Stop barking immediately on single click
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: click
    event_data:
      entity_id: binary_sensor.switch_158d000xxxxxc2

```


## {% linkable_title Troubleshooting %}

### {% linkable_title Initial setup problem %}

If you run into trouble initializing the gateway with your app, try another smartphone. E.g., it didn't work on an OnePlus 3, but it worked with a Nexus 5.

### {% linkable_title Connection problem %}

```bash
2017-08-20 16:51:19 ERROR (SyncWorker_0) [homeassistant.components.xiaomi] No gateway discovered
2017-08-20 16:51:20 ERROR (MainThread) [homeassistant.setup] Setup failed for xiaomi: Component failed to initialize.
```

That means that Home Assistant is not getting any response from your Xiaomi gateway. Might be a local network problem or your firewall.
- Make sure you have [enabled LAN access](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Xiaomi_Gateway_(Aqara)#Adding_the_Xiaomi_Gateway_to_Domoticz).
- Turn off the firewall on the system where Home Assistant is running.
- Ensure your router supports multicast as this is a requirement of the Xiaomi Gateway.
- Try to leave the MAC address `mac:` blank.
- Try to set `discovery_retry: 10`.
- Try to disable and then enable LAN access.
- Hard reset the gateway: Press the button of the gateway 30 seconds and start again from scratch.
- If you are using Home Assistant in [Docker](/docs/installation/docker/), make sure to use `--net=host`.
- If you receive an `{"error":"Invalid key"}` in your log while trying to control the gateway light, you should generate the key again using an Android Phone or alternatively an emulator such as [bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com). In some instances there is an issue with keys being generated using the iOS application.
- If the required library "PyXiaomiGateway" cannot be installed you will need to install some missing system dependencies `python3-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `libffi-dev` manually (e.g., `$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev`).
