The Nest component is the main component to integrate all [Nest](https://nest.com/) related platforms. To connect Nest, you will have to [sign up for a developer account](https://developers.nest.com/products) and get a `client_id` and `client_secret`.

### {% linkable_title Setting up developer account %}

1. Visit [Nest Developers](https://developers.nest.com/), and sign in. Create an account if you don't have one already.
2. Fill in account details:
  - The "Company Information" can be anything. We recommend using your name.
3. Submit changes
4. Click "[Products](https://developers.nest.com/products)" at top of page.
5. Click "[Create New Product](https://developers.nest.com/products/new)"
6. Fill in details:
  - Product name must be unique. We recommend [email] - Home Assistant.
  - The description, users, URLs can all be anything you want.
  - Leave the "Redirect URI" Field blank
7. For permissions check every box and if it's an option select the read/write option.
  - The description requires a specific format to be accepted.
    - Use "[Home Assistant] [Edit] [For Home Automation]" as the description as it is not super important.
8. Click "Create Product"
9. Once the new product page opens the "Product ID" and "Product Secret" are located on the right side. These will be used as `client_id` and `client_secret` below.
10. Once Home Assistant is started, a configurator will pop up asking you to log into your Nest account and copy a PIN code into Home Assistant.

Connecting to the Nest Developer API requires outbound port 9553 on your firewall. The configuration will fail if this is not accessible.

### {% linkable_title Configuration %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
nest:
  client_id: CLIENT_ID
  client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET
```

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry to show only devices at your vacation and primary homes
nest:
  client_id: CLIENT_ID
  client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET
  structure:
    - Vacation
    - Primary
```

Configuration variables:

- **client_id** (*Required*): Your Nest developer client ID.
- **client_secret** (*Required*): Your Nest developer client secret.
- **structure** (*Optional*): The structure or structures you would like to include devices from. If not specified, this will include all structures in your Nest account.

### {% linkable_title Services %}

Currently there is a single `nest.set_mode` service available to switch between
"away" and "home" modes. This service requires a `home_mode` param and has an
optional `structure` param.

```yaml
# Example script to set away, no structure specified so will execute for all
set_nest_away:
  sequence:
    - service: nest.set_mode
      data:
        home_mode: away
```

```yaml
# Example script to set home, structure specified
set_nest_home:
  sequence:
    - service: nest.set_mode
      data:
        home_mode: home
        structure:
          - Building
```
