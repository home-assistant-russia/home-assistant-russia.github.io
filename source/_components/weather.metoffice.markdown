The `metoffice` weather platform uses the Met Office's [DataPoint API][datapoint] for weather data.

To add the Met Office weather platform to your installation, you'll need to register for a free API key at the link above and then add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
weather:
  - platform: metoffice
    api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

Configuration variables:

- **api_key** (*Required*): Your personal API key from the [Datapoint website](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint).

<p class='note'>
This platform is an alternative to the [`metoffice`](/components/sensor.metoffice/) sensor.
The weather platform is easier to configure but less customizable.
