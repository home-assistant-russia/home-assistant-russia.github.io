Before you can use the IHC Light platform, you must setup the [IHC Component](/components/ihc/)

When auto setup is enabled the following products will be found in the IHC project and setup as light devices:

* Wireless lamp outlet dimmer
* Wireless dimmer
* Wireless combi dimmer 4 buttons
* Wireless lamp outlet relay
* Wireless combi relay 4 buttons
* Wireless mobile dimmer
* Dataline lamp outlet

To manually configure IHC lights insert this section in your configuration:

```yaml
light:
  - platform: ihc
    lights:
      - id: 12345
        name: tablelight
        dimmable: True
      - id: 12346
        name: anotherlight
      ...
```

{% configuration %}
lights:
  description: List of lights to setup manually
  required: false
  type: map
  keys:
    dimmable:
      description: Set to True if the IHC resource is a light level
      required: false
      type: bool
      default: false
    id:
      description: The IHC resource id.
      required: true
      type: int
    name:
      description: The name of the component
      required: false
      type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

In the example above 12345 is ihc resource id and "tablelight" is the name. 
The IHC resource id can be a light level for dimmers or a boolean output of a relay. 
For more information about IHC resource ids see [Manual Setup](/components/ihc/#manual-setup)
