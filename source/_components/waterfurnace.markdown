The `waterfurnace` component communicates with the WaterFurnace Symphony website's WebSocket to show you many of the sensors in your
system. While not an official API, this is the same backend the Symphony website is based on, and should be reasonably stable.

The sensors provided include:

 - Thermostat Setpoint
 - Thermostat Current Temp
 - Leaving Air Temp
 - Entering Water Loop Temp
 - Current Humidity
 - Current Humidity Setpoint
 - Total system power (in Watts)
 - Furnace Mode

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To use Waterfurnace in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
waterfurnace:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
  unit: 0123456789AB
```

{% configuration %}
username:
  description: The email address for your Symphony WaterFurnace account
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: The password for your Symphony WaterFurnace account
  required: true
  type: string
unit:
  description: The unit serial number for your WaterFurnace
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}


#### {% linkable_title Limitations %}

The WebSocket interface used by this module requires active polling, otherwise the server side shuts down the connection. By default, this polling is happening every 10 seconds. All sensors are updated during every polling cycle.

While this is communicating with a thermostat, geothermal systems operate most efficiently when setbacks are not used, and the home is kept at a constant temperature. It remains useful to collect the data from the system to understand its performance, but a full climate interface won't be implemented.
