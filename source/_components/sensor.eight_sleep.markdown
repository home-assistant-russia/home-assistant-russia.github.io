The `eight_sleep` sensor platform lets you observe states of [Eight Sleep](https://eightsleep.com/) sensors through Home Assistant. This includes bed state and results of the current and previous sleep sessions.

Devices will be configured automatically. Please refer to the [component](/components/eight_sleep/) configuration on how to setup.
