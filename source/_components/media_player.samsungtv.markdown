The `samsungtv` platform allows you to control a [Samsung Smart TV](http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/tv-audio-video/televisions/).

When the TV is first connected, you will need to accept Home Assistant on the TV to allow communication.

To add a TV to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: samsungtv
    host: 192.168.0.10
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): The IP of the Samsung Smart TV, eg. `192.168.0.10`.
- **port** (*Optional*): The port of the Samsung Smart TV. Defaults to 55000. If set to 8001, the new websocket connection will be used (required for 2016+ TVs).
- **name** (*Optional*): The name you would like to give to the Samsung Smart TV.
- **timeout** (*Optional*): The time-out in seconds for the communication with the TV. Defaults to 0 (no timeout).
- **mac** (*Optional*): The MAC address of the Samsung Smart TV, eg. `00:11:22:33:44:55:66`. Required for power on support via wake on lan.

- U6000 (port must be set to 8001)
- U6300 (port must be set to 8001, and `pip3 install websocket-client` must be executed)

- KU6290 (port must be set to 8001)
- KU7000 (port must be set to 8001)
- MU6170UXZG (port must be set to 8001, and `pip3 install websocket-client` must be executed)
- KS7502 (port must be set to 8001, and `pip3 install websocket-client` must be executed, turn on doesn't work, turn off works fine)
- K5600AK (partially supported, turn on works but state is not updated)
- UE65KS8005 (port must be set to 8001, On/Off, Forward/Backward, Volume are OK, but no Play button)

Currently tested but not working models:

- J5200 - Unable to see state and unable to control
- J5500 - State is always "on" and unable to control (but port 8001 *is* open)
- JU7000 - Unable to see state and unable to control (but port 8001 *is* open)
- JU7500 - Unable to see state and unable to control
- JS9000 - State is always "on" and unable to control (but port 8001 *is* open)
- JS9500 - State is always "on" and unable to control (but port 8001 *is* open)
- MU6300 - Port set to 8001, `pip3 install websocket-client` must be executed, turning on works, status not working reliably, turning off is not permanent (it comes back on)
 
None of the 2014 (H) and 2015 (J) model series (e.g., J5200) will work, since Samsung have used a different (encrypted) type of interface for these.

If your model is not on the list then give it a test, if everything works correctly then add it to the list on [GitHub](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.github.io/tree/current/source/_components/media_player.samsungtv.markdown).
The first letter (U, P, L, H & K) represent the screen type, e.g., LED or Plasma. The second letter represents the region, E is Europe, N is North America and A is Asia & Australia. The two numbers following that represent the screen size.
If you add your model remember to remove these before adding them to the list.

Currently the ability to select a source is not implemented.

There's currently a [known issue](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues/2098) with some TVs receiving a *Key press UP* that can interrupt certain applications. This should be fixed as of March 2017.
