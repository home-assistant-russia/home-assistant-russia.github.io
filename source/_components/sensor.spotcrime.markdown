The `spotcrime` sensor allows one to track reported incidents occurring in a given area. Incidents include anything reported to [Spot Crime](http://spotcrime.com). Your regional emergency services may or may not report data. The sensor defaults to counting incidents within one day, but can be customized via configuration.yaml.

You will need to request an API key from [Spotcrime](mailto:pyrrhus@spotcrime.com).

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`. Your `radius` should be of sufficient size to capture incidents in your area. 0.01 = 1 mile.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: spotcrime
    name: <any name>
    radius: <your radius>
    api_key: <"your_api_key_here">
```

{% configuration %}
name:
  description: Name the sensor what you'd like.
  required: true
  type: string
radius:
  description: Radius you'd like to search within. 0.01 = 1 mile.
  required: true
  type: float
api_key:

  required: true
  type: string

{% endconfiguration %}

### {% linkable_title Incident Types %}

You can explicitly include or exclude incident types. Specifying `include`s restricts the incidents to those types. Specifying `exclude`s will return all incident types except those specified.

These incident types are available:

- Arrest
- Arson
- Assault
- Burglary
- Robbery
- Shooting
- Theft
- Vandalism
- Other

### {% linkable_title Events %}

The `crimealerts` sensor fires a `crimealerts_incident` event when a new incident is detected, including the type, time, and location of the incident.
