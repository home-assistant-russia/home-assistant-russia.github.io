The `mqtt_json` light platform lets you control a MQTT-enabled light that can receive [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) messages.

This platform supports on/off, brightness, RGB colors, XY colors, color temperature, transitions, short/long flashing and white values. The messages sent to/from the lights look similar to this, omitting fields when they aren't needed:

```json
{
  "brightness": 255,
  "color_temp": 155,
  "color": {
    "r": 255,
    "g": 255,
    "b": 255,
    "x": 0.123,
    "y": 0.123
  },
  "effect": "colorloop",
  "state": "ON",
  "transition": 2,
  "white_value": 150
}
```

In an ideal scenario, the MQTT device will have a state topic to publish state changes. If these messages are published with the RETAIN flag, the MQTT light will receive an instant state update after subscription and will start with the correct state. Otherwise, the initial state of the light will be off.

When a state topic is not available, the light will work in optimistic mode. In this mode, the light will immediately change state after every command. Otherwise, the light will wait for state confirmation from the device (message from `state_topic`).

Optimistic mode can be forced, even if state topic is available. Try enabling it if the light is operating incorrectly.

<p class='note warning'>
  Make sure that your topics match exact. `some-topic/` and `some-topic` are different topics.

  XY and RGB can not be used at the same time. If both are provided, XY overrides RGB.

## {% linkable_title Examples %}

In this section you find some real life examples of how to use this sensor.

### {% linkable_title Brightness and RGB support %}

To enable a light with brightness and RGB support in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt_json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/rgb1"
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    brightness: true
    rgb: true
```

### {% linkable_title Brightness and no RGB support %}

To enable a light with brightness (but no color support) in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt_json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/rgb1"
    command_topic: "home/rgb1/set"
    brightness: true
```

### {% linkable_title Brightness Scaled %}

To enable a light using a brightness scale other than 8bit the `brightness_scale` option may be added to denote the "fully on" value:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
light:
  - platform: mqtt_json
    name: mqtt_json_light_1
    state_topic: "home/light"
    command_topic: "home/light/set"
    brightness: true
    brightness_scale: 4095
```

Home Assistant will then convert its 8bit value in the message to and from the device:

```json
{
  "brightness": 4095,
  "state": "ON",
}
```

### {% linkable_title Implementations %}

- A full example of custom lighting using this platform and an ESP8266 microcontroller can be found [here](https://github.com/corbanmailloux/esp-mqtt-rgb-led). It supports on/off, brightness, transitions, RGB colors, and flashing.

- There is also another implementation forked from the above repo, it supports all the same features but is made for addressable LED strips using FastLED on a NodeMCU V3 it can be found [here](https://github.com/JammyDodger231/nodemcu-mqtt-rgb-led).

- [MQTT JSON Light](https://github.com/mertenats/Open-Home-Automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_rgbw_light_with_discovery) is another implementation for ESP8266 including [MQTT discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/).

- [esphomelib](https://github.com/OttoWinter/esphomelib) is a library for ESP8266 and ESP32 boards that has many of Home Assistant's MQTT features (like [discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/)) pre-implemented and provides high-level abstractions for components such as lights or sensors.

- [AiLight](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight) is a custom firmware for the Ai-Thinker (and equivalent) RGBW WiFi light bulbs that has an ESP8266 onboard and controlled by the MY9291 LED driver. It implements the [MQTT JSON light](/components/light.mqtt_json/) platform and supports ON/OFF, RGBW colours, brightness, colour temperature, flashing and transitions. Also it includes [MQTT Auto Discovery](/docs/mqtt/discovery/)) and the MQTT Last Will and Testament is enabled as well.
