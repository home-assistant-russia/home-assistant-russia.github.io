The `volvooncall` platform offers integration with the [Volvo On Call](http://www.volvocars.com/intl/own/connectivity/volvo-on-call) cloud service and offers presence detection as well as sensors such as odometer and fuel level.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
volvooncall:

```

or

  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
  name:
