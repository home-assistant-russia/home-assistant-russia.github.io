The `toon` climate platform allows you to interact with your Toon thermostat. For compatibility reasons, the states in Home Assistant are different from the states displayed on your Toon device and are mapped as follows:


| Home Assistant | Toon    |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Performance    | Comfort |
| Heat           | Thuis   |
| Eco            | Weg     |
| Cool           | Slapen  |


Please refer to the [hub component](/components/toon/) for setup instructions.
