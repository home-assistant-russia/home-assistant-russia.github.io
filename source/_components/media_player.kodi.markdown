The `kodi` platform allows you to control a [Kodi](http://kodi.tv/) multimedia system from Home Assistant.

To add Kodi to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  - platform: kodi
    host: 192.168.0.123
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): The host name or address of the device that is running XBMC/Kodi.
- **port** (*Optional*): The HTTP port number. Defaults to 8080.
- **tcp_port** (*Optional*): The TCP port number. Defaults to 9090. Used for websocket connections to Kodi.
- **name** (*Optional*): The name of the device used in the frontend.
- **proxy_ssl** (*Optional*): Connect to kodi with HTTPS and WSS. Defaults to `false`. Useful if Kodi is behind an SSL proxy.
- **username** (*Optional*): The XBMC/Kodi HTTP username.
- **password** (*Optional*): The XBMC/Kodi HTTP password.
- **turn_on_action** (*Optional*): Home Assistant script sequence to call when turning on.
- **turn_off_action** (*Optional*): Home Assistant script sequence to call when turning off.
- **enable_websocket** (*Optional*): Enable websocket connections to Kodi via the TCP port. Defaults to `true`. The websocket connection allows Kodi to push updates to Home Assistant and removes the need for Home Assistant to poll. If websockets don't work on your installation this can be set to `false`.
- **timeout** (*Optional*): Set timeout for connections to Kodi. Defaults to 5 seconds.


### {% linkable_title Service `kodi_add_to_playlist` %}

Add music to the default playlist (i.e. playlistid=0).

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | no | Name(s) of the Kodi entities where to add the media.
| `media_type` | yes | Media type identifier. It must be one of SONG or ALBUM.
| `media_id` | no | Unique Id of the media entry to add (`songid` or `albumid`). If not defined, `media_name` and `artist_name` are needed to search the Kodi music library.
| `media_name` | no| Optional media name for filtering media. Can be 'ALL' when `media_type` is 'ALBUM' and `artist_name` is specified, to add all songs from one artist.
| `artist_name` | no | Optional artist name for filtering media.


### {% linkable_title Service `kodi_call_method` %}

Call a [Kodi JSONRPC API](http://kodi.wiki/?title=JSON-RPC_API) method with optional parameters. Results of the Kodi API call will be redirected in a Home Assistant event: `kodi_call_method_result`.

| Service data attribute | Optional | Description |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `entity_id` | no | Name(s) of the Kodi entities where to run the API method.
| `method` | yes | Name of the Kodi JSONRPC API method to be called.
| any other parameter | no | Optional parameters for the Kodi API call.


### {% linkable_title Event triggering %}

When calling the `kodi_call_method` service, if the Kodi JSONRPC API returns data, when received by Home Assistant it will fire a `kodi_call_method_result` event on the event bus with the following `event_data`:

```yaml
entity_id: "<Kodi media_player entity_id>"
result_ok: <boolean>
input: <input parameters of the service call>
result: <data received from the Kodi API>
```

### {% linkable_title Kodi turn on/off samples %}

With the `turn_on_action` and `turn_off_action` parameters you can run any combination of Home Assistant actions to turn on/off your Kodi instance. Here are a few examples of this usage, including the **migration instructions for the old `turn_off_action` list of options**.

#### Turn on Kodi with Wake on LAN

With this configuration, when calling `media_player/turn_on` on the Kodi device, a _magic packet_ will be sent to the specified MAC address. To use this service, first you need to config the [`wake_on_lan`](/components/wake_on_lan) component in Home Assistant, which is achieved simply by adding `wake_on_lan:` to your `configuration.yaml`.

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: kodi
    host: 192.168.0.123
    turn_on_action:
      - service: wake_on_lan.send_magic_packet
        data:
          mac: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
          broadcast_address: 192.168.255.255
```

#### Turn off Kodi with API calls

Here are the equivalent ways to configure each of the old options to turn off Kodi (`quit`, `hibernate`, `suspend`, `reboot`, or `shutdown`):

- **Quit** method (before was `turn_off_action: quit`)

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: kodi
    host: 192.168.0.123
    turn_off_action:
      service: media_player.kodi_call_method
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
        method: Application.Quit
```

- **Hibernate** method (before was `turn_off_action: hibernate`)

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: kodi
    host: 192.168.0.123
    turn_off_action:
      service: media_player.kodi_call_method
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
        method: System.Hibernate
```

- **Suspend** method (before was `turn_off_action: suspend`)

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: kodi
    host: 192.168.0.123
    turn_off_action:
      service: media_player.kodi_call_method
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
        method: System.Suspend
```

- **Reboot** method (before was `turn_off_action: reboot`)

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: kodi
    host: 192.168.0.123
    turn_off_action:
      service: media_player.kodi_call_method
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
        method: System.Reboot
```

- **Shutdown** method (before was `turn_off_action: shutdown`)

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: kodi
    host: 192.168.0.123
    turn_off_action:
      service: media_player.kodi_call_method
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
        method: System.Shutdown
```

#### Turn on and off the TV with the Kodi JSON-CEC Add-on

For Kodi devices running 24/7 attached to a CEC capable TV (OSMC / OpenElec and systems alike running in Rasperry Pi's, for example), this configuration enables the optimal way to turn on/off the attached TV from Home Assistant while Kodi is always active and ready:

```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: kodi
    host: 192.168.0.123
    turn_on_action:
      service: media_player.kodi_call_method
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
        method: Addons.ExecuteAddon
        addonid: script.json-cec
        params:
          command: activate
    turn_off_action:
    - service: media_player.media_stop
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
    - service: media_player.kodi_call_method
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kodi
        method: Addons.ExecuteAddon
        addonid: script.json-cec
        params:
          command: standby
```

<p class='note'>
This example and the following requires to have the [script.json-cec](https://github.com/joshjowen/script.json-cec) plugin installed on your kodi player. It'll also expose th endpoints standy, toggle and activate without authentication on your kodi player. Use this with caution.

### {% linkable_title Kodi services samples %}

#### Simple script to turn on the PVR in some channel as a time function

```yaml
script:
  play_kodi_pvr:
    alias: Turn on the silly box
    sequence:
      - alias: TV on
        service: media_player.turn_on
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.kodi

      - alias: Play TV channel
        service: media_player.play_media
        data_template:
          entity_id: media_player.kodi
          media_content_type: "CHANNEL"
          media_content_id: >
            {% raw %}{% if (now().hour < 14) or ((now().hour == 14) and (now().minute < 50)) %}
              10
            {% elif (now().hour < 16) %}
              15
            {% elif (now().hour < 20) %}
              2
            {% elif (now().hour == 20) and (now().minute < 50) %}
              10
            {% elif (now().hour == 20) or ((now().hour == 21) and (now().minute < 15)) %}
              15
            {% else %}
              10
            {% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

#### Trigger a Kodi video library update

```yaml
script:
  update_library:
    alias: Update Kodi Library
    sequence:
      - alias: Call Kodi update
        service: media_player.kodi_call_method
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.kodi
          method: VideoLibrary.Scan
```

For a more complex usage of the `kodi_call_method` service, with event triggering of Kodi API results, you can have a look at this [example](/cookbook/automation_kodi_dynamic_input_select/)
