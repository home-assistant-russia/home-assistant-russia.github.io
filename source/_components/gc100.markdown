The Global Caché [GC-100](https://www.globalcache.com/products/gc-100/) can be integrated into Home Assistant. GC-100 is a TCP-controllable
hardware device which has an array of relays, RS232 serial ports, and flexible ports which can be programmed to be either digital inputs or IR blaster outputs. There are a variety of submodels of the GC-100 which have different amounts of each I/O type.

Currently, only relays and ports configured to be digital inputs are supported in Home Assistant. For IR support, please use the iTach remote platform (/components/remote.itach/), but note that it will likely not function concurrently on the same GC100 due to limitations in the TCP socket server implementation used by Global Caché.

To enable this device, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
gc100:
  host: 192.168.1.114
  port: 4998
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** (*Required*): The hostname/IP address of your GC100 device.
- **port** (*Optional*): The port on which the GC100 is listening.
