A sensor platform for the [DTE](https://www.dteenergy.com/) Energy Bridge. To find out which version of the DTE Energy Bridge sensor you have, find the status LED on your box.

 - If the status LED is on the top, you have a v1.
 - If the status LED is on the front, you have a v2.

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: dte_energy_bridge
    ip: 192.168.1.11
```

Configuration variables:

- **ip** (*Required*): The IP address of your bridge.
- **name** (*Optional*): Name to use in the frontend.
- **version** (*Optional*): Hardware version of the sensor. Defaults to 1.
