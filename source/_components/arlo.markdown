The `arlo` implementation allows you to integrate your [Arlo](https://arlo.netgear.com/) devices in Home Assistant.

## {% linkable_title Configuration %}

To enable device linked in your [Arlo](https://arlo.netgear.com/) account, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
arlo:
  username: YOUR_USERNAME
  password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

{% configuration %}
username:
  description: The username for accessing your Arlo account.
  required: true
  type: string
password:
  description: The password for accessing your Arlo account.
  required: true
  type: string
{% endconfiguration %}

It is recommended to create a dedicated user on Arlo website to be used within Home Assistant and then share your Arlo cameras.

Finish its configuration by visiting the [Arlo sensor page](/components/sensor.arlo/) or [Arlo camera page](/components/camera.arlo/) or [Arlo control panel page](/components/alarm_control_panel.arlo/).

The Arlo component also provides a service to enable/disable the motion detection sensor. The example below enables the motion detection every time the Home Assistant service starts.

```yaml
#automation.yaml
- alias: Enable Arlo upton HA start'
  initial_state: 'on'
  trigger:
    platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action:
    service: camera.enable_motion_detection
    entity_id: camera.arlo_frontdoor
```
