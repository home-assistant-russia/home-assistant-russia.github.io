The `thinkingcleaner` switch platform allows you to control your [Thinking Cleaner](http://www.thinkingcleaner.com) add-on.

To enable this switch in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  - platform: thinkingcleaner
```

This will automatically add switches for each Thinking Cleaner in your network.
