This component adds "local push" support for INSTEON PowerLinc Modems allowing
linked INSTEON devices to be used within Home Assistant as lights, switches,
and binary sensors.  Device support is provided by the underlying [insteonplm]
package.  It is known to work with the [2413U] USB and [2412S] RS242 flavors
of PLM and the [2448A7] USB stick.  This component does not work with the 
IP-based hub products.  For that, you'll want the "Insteon (Local)" component 
instead.

```yaml
# insteon_plm supported configuration variables
insteon_plm:
  port: SERIAL_PORT
  device_override:
     - address: ADDRESS
       cat: CATEGORY
       subcat: SUBCATEGORY
       firmware: FIRMWARE
       product_key: PRODUCT_KEY
```
Configuration variables:
- **port** (*Required*): The port for your device, e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`
- **device_override** (*Optional*): Override the default device definition
  - *ADDRESS* is found on the device itself in the form 1A.2B.3C or 1a2b3c
  - *CATEGORY* is found in the back of the device's User Guide in the form of
    0x00 - 0xff
  - *SUBCATEGORY* is found in the back of the device's User Guide in the form 
    of 0x00 - 0xff
  - *FIRMWARE* and *PRODUCT_KEY* are more advanced options and will typically 
    not be used.

### {% linkable_title Autodiscovery %}

The first time autodiscovery runs, the duration may require up to 20 seconds 
per device. Subsequent startups will occur much quicker using cached device
information. If a device is not recognized during autodiscovery, you can add
the device to the **device_override** configuration. 

In order for a device to be discovered it must be linked to the PLM as either
a responder or a controller. 

### {% linkable_title Linking Devices to the PLM %}

In order for any two Insteon devices to talk with one another, they must be 
linked. For an overview of device linking please read the Insteon page on
[understanding linking]. Currently Insteon PLM does not support software
linking of devices. If you need software that can link your devices (if you 
are using a USB Stick PLM for example), you can download [HouseLinc] which runs
on any Windows PC, or you can use [Insteon Terminal] which is open source and 
runs on most platforms. HouseLinc is no longer supported by SmartHome but it 
still works. Insteon Terminal is a very useful tool but please read the 
disclaimers carefully, they are important.

### {% linkable_title Customization %} 

The only configuration item that is absolutely necessary is the port so that
Home Assistant can connect to the PLM.  This will expose all the supported INSTEON
devices which exist in the modem's ALL-Link database.  However, devices will
only be shown by their INSTEON hex address (e.g., "1A.2B.3C") which can be a bit
unwieldy.  As you link and unlink devices using the 'Set' buttons, they'll be
added and removed from Home Assistant automatically.

You can use the normal Home Assistant [device customization] section of your
configuration to assign friendly names and special icons to your devices.  This
is especially useful for setting device_class on your binary_sensor INSTEON
devices.

### {% linkable_title Device Overrides %} 

INSTEON devices are added to Home Assistant using the platform(s) that make the
most sense given the model and features of the hardware. The features of the 
INSTEON device are built into the Home Assistant platform. Changing the 
platform is not recommended. There are two primary uses for the 
**device_override** feature.
- Devices that do not respond during autodiscovery. This is common for battery
  operated devices.
- Devices that have not been fully developed. This allows an unknown device to
  be mapped to a device that operates similarly to another device.

### {% linkable_title Example Configuration with Options%} 

```yaml
# Full example of insteon_plm configuration with customizations and overrides

homeassistant:
  customize:
    light.a1b2c3:
      friendly_name: Bedside Lamp
    binary_sensor.a2b3c4:
      friendly_name: Garage Door
      device_class: opening

insteon_plm:
  port: /dev/ttyUSB0
  device_override:
    - address: a1b2c3  # Hidden Door Sensor [2845-222]
      cat: 0x10
      subcat: 0x11     
```
### {% linkable_title What NOT to do %}
Insteon PLM is a top level component and device discovery will identify 
the Home Assistant platform the device belongs in. As such, do not 
declare Insteon devices in other platforms. For example, this configuration
will NOT work:

```yaml
light:
  - platform: insteon_plm
    address: 1a2b3c
```
