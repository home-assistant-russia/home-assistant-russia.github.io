The `kira` platform allows you to respond to your [Kira](https://www.keene.co.uk/keene-ir-anywhere-single-worldwide.html) modules from within Home Assistant. This enables Home Assistant to respond to infrared inputs from a standard remote control.

For configuration information see the [Kira component](/components/kira/) documentation.
