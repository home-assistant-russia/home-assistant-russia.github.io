The `rfxtrx` platform supports Siemens/LightwaveRF and RFY roller shutters that communicate in the frequency range of 433.92 MHz.

First you have to set up your [rfxtrx hub](/components/rfxtrx/).

### {% linkable_title Configuration %}

##### {% linkable_title Siemens/LightwaveRF %}

The easiest way to find your roller shutters is to add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
cover:
  - platform: rfxtrx
    automatic_add: True
```

Launch your homeassistant and go the website (e.g http://localhost:8123). Push your remote and your device should be added.

Once added it will show an ID (e.g `0b11000102ef9f210010f70`) and you can verify that it works from the frontend. Then you should update your configuration to:

```yaml
cover:
  - platform: rfxtrx
    devices:
      0b11000102ef9f210010f70:
        name: device_name
```

##### {% linkable_title RFY %}

The [RFXtrx433e](http://www.rfxcom.com/RFXtrx433E-USB-43392MHz-Transceiver/en) is required for RFY support, however it does not support receive for the RFY protocol - as such devices cannot be automatically added. Instead, configure the device in the [rfxmngr](http://www.rfxcom.com/downloads.htm) tool. Make a note of the assigned ID and Unit Code and then add a device to the configuration with the following id `071a0000[id][unit_code]`. Eg, if the id was `0a` `00` `01`, and the unit code was `01` then the fully qualified id would be `071a00000a000101`, if you set your id/code to single digit in the rfxmngr eg, id: `1` `02` `04` and unit code: `1` you will need to add `0` before, so `102031` becomes `071a000001020301`.

##### {% linkable_title Common %}

Example configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
  - platform: rfxtrx
    automatic_add: False
    signal_repetitions: 2
    devices:
      0b1100ce3213c7f210010f70: # Siemens/LightwaveRF
        name: Bedroom Shutter
      071a00000a000101: # RFY
        name: Bathroom Shutter
```

Configuration variables:

- **devices** (*Required*): A list of devices with their name to use in the frontend.
- **automatic_add** (*Optional*): To enable the automatic addition of new covers (Siemens/LightwaveRF only).
- **signal_repetitions** (*Optional*): Because the rxftrx device sends its actions via radio and from most receivers it's impossible to know if the signal was received or not. Therefore you can configure the roller shutter to try to send each signal repeatedly.
- **fire_event** (*Optional*): Fires an event even if the state is the same as before. Can be used for automations.
