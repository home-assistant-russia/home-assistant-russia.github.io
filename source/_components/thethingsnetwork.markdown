The `thethingsnetwork` component allows one to interact with the [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org). This community-driven and open network supports [LoRaWAN](https://www.lora-alliance.org/) for long range (~5 to 15km) communication with a low bandwidth (51 bytes/message). [Gateways](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/) transfers the received data from the sensors to the The Things Network.

The Things network support various integrations to make the data available:

| The Things Network Integration | Home Assistant platform |
|---|---|
| [MQTT](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/mqtt/) | |
| [Storage](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/storage/) | [`thethingsnetwork`](/component/sensor.thethingsnetwork/) |
| [HTTP](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/http/) | |

### {% linkable_title Setup %}
