The `openhardwaremonitor` platform uses your [Open Hardware Monitor](http://openhardwaremonitor.org/) installation as a source for sensors that will display system information.

To add Open Hardware Monitor to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: openhardwaremonitor
    host: IP_ADDRESS
```

{% configuration %}
  host:
    description: The IP address or hostname of the system where Open Hardware Monitor is running.
    required: true
    type: string
  port:
    description: The port of your Open Hardware Monitor API. Defaults to 8085.
    required: false
    type: int
{% endconfiguration %}

<p class='note'>
OpenHardwareMonitor must be running on the host, with "Remote web server" active.
You also need to open an inbound port for (TCP 8085) in the advanced firewall settings.
</p>
