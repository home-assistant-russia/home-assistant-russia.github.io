Notification platform for [Notifications for Android TV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.cyberdream.androidtv.notifications.google) and [Notifications for FireTV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.cyberdream.firenotifications.google).

The notifications are in the global scope of your Android TV device. They will be displayed regardless of which application is running.

When setting this up be aware, that there are two apps: one for your smartphone to send notifications (not required for this platform) and one for your Android TV device to receive the notifications. The app available in the store of your target device is the one that is needed to display notifications sent from Home Assistant. The In-App purchases only apply to the client for Android smartphones, so there isn't any limit when pushing notifications from Home Assistant.

To enable the notification platform, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
notify:
  - platform: nfandroidtv
    name: Kitchen
    host: 192.168.1.12
```

Configuration variables:

- **name** (*Optional*): Setting the optional parameter `name` allows multiple notifiers to be created. The default value is `notify`. The notifier will bind to the service `notify.NOTIFIER_NAME`.
- **host** (*Required*): IP address of the Android TV / FireTV device.
- **duration** (*Optional*): The duration in seconds for which the notification will be displayed. Default is 5 seconds.
- **position** (*Optional*): Has to be one of: bottom-right (default), bottom-left, top-right, top-left, center
- **color** (*Optional*): Has to be one of: grey (default), black, indigo, green, red, cyan, teal, amber, pink
- **transparency** (*Optional*): Has to be one of: 0%, 25% (default), 50%, 75%, 100%
- **interrupt** (*Optional*): If set to true, 1, on etc., the notification is interactive and can be dismissed or selected to display more details. Depending on the running app (e.g., Netflix), this may stop playback.

The configuration will be used to configure the default values for the notification for the host specified by the IP. However, you can override most of the settings by passing them with the data-attribute when calling the service.
This is a fully customized JSON you can use to test how the final notification will look like:

```json
{
"message": "Messagetext",
"title": "My Notification",
"data":{
    "position":"center",
    "duration":2,
    "transparency":"0%",
    "color": "red",
    "interrupt": 1
    }
}
```
