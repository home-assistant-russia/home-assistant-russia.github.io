What time is it? Yep, t-shirt time. Today we're launching the first two Home Assistant designs. We have a blue t-shirt ([ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡º EU][blue-eu] â€“ [ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ US][blue-us]) as pictured above and a design for on black/gray shirts ([ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡º EU][black-eu] â€“ [ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ US][black-us]) as pictured below.

And because we love the internet and all the things that it has brought us, **we will start with having 100% of the profit from the sales be donated to the [Electronic Frontier Foundation][eff]**. If you buy a shirt you will hit two birds with one stone (figuratively): you get to wear a kick-ass Home Assistant t-shirt and you help fund defending civil liberties in the digital world.

The EFF is a nonprofit organization that aims to protect the rights of technology users. You might however be more familiar with one of their projects: [Let's Encrypt][le]. [Read more about what the EFF does.][eff-issues]

So, what are you waiting for? Get yourself a shirt! [ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡º EU store][store-eu] â€“ [ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ US store][store-us]

We are using [Teespring.com][ts] to manage all the sales, production and distribution of the shirts and they will also donate our profits to the EFF. It's also how we got all these amazing stockphotos. Some extra things to note about our teespring shop:

 - Teespring shows that there is a number of days left until the end of the campaign for the shirts. Don't worry about that, it should automatically relaunch.
