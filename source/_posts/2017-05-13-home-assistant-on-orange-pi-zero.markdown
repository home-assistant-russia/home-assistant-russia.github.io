This blog post is about the setup of Home Assistant on an [Orange Pi Zero](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizero/). Like the setup on a [Raspberry Pi Zero](/blog/2017/05/01/home-assistant-on-raspberry-pi-zero-in-30-minutes/) it will only take a couple of minutes to get a fully functional super cheap (less than 18 Euro incl. casing and power supply) Home Assistant hub. The reasons to use an Orange Pi Zero beside the prize are the built-in Ethernet port and the availability.

Download the [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-zero/) and create the SD card with [Etcher](https://etcher.io/). There is no possibility to connect a display to the Orange Pi Zero. This means that you need a wired network setup with DHCP server. After your Orange Pi Zero is running, give it some time, and look for its IP address. The hostname is `orangepizero`.

If you found the IP address then use your SSH client to connect to the Orange Pi Zero. The default password is `1234`.

```bash
$ ssh root@192.168.0.151
[...]
root@192.168.0.151's password: 
You are required to change your password immediately (root enforced)

Let's run an upgrade to make sure that all available packages are up-to-date.

```bash
root@orangepizero:~# apt-get upgrade
```
Now, we are installing the requirements for Home Assistant.

```bash
root@orangepizero:~# apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv
```

Those steps to install Home Assistant are described in the [documentation](/docs/installation/armbian/) and the guide for [`venv`](/docs/installation/virtualenv/) as well. Switch to the create user `ha` and perform the remaining installation steps which are reduced to the minimum below:

```bash
ha@orangepizero:~$ pyvenv-3.5 homeassistant
ha@orangepizero:~$ cd homeassistant && source bin/activate
(homeassistant) ha@orangepizero:~/homeassistant$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
(homeassistant) ha@orangepizero:~/homeassistant$ pip3 install homeassistant
(homeassistant) ha@orangepizero:~/homeassistant$ hass
```
