It is well known that you are either a good programmer or a good designer. It's rare you'll meet someone that is both. That's why it wasn't surprising to anyone that the logo that I made was mediocre &mdash; at best. Luckily, [Jeremy Geltman](http://jeremygeltman.com/) has come to the rescue and contributed a brand new logo for Home Assistant.

The new logo follows Googles material design spec. It uses the blue color that Home Assistant uses in the interface and it comes in two versions: a high detailed version (for homescreen icon etc) and a simple version (for favicon etc).

The old logo, the new detailed logo and the new simple logo.
