We are always hard at work at the virtual Home Assistant headquarters to make it easier for you to get started with Home Assistant. That's why [@jbags81] recently introduced the [all-in-one installer]. It allows you to get up and running with a complete Home Assistant setup by entering one line of code into your Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Jessie:

```bash
wget -Nnv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/home-assistant/fabric-home-assistant/master/hass_rpi_installer.sh && bash hass_rpi_installer.sh;
```

This feature wouldn't be complete if it wasn't accompanied by a new video by Ben from [BRUH Automation](http://www.bruhautomation.com). The video shows how to install Raspbian Jessie on your Raspberry Pi and use the new installation script to get a full Home Assistant system up and running.
