This new release finally brings us the release of Hassbian based on the release of Raspbian Stretch. The most significant change with this is that we now run Home Assistant on Python 3.5.
Other than that the changes are mostly to our tool `hassbian-config`.

### {% linkable_title Hassbian-config %}

To allow you to customize your installation further, we have made a few additions to our tool called `hassbian-config`. Majority of these changes where contributed by [@Ludeeus][ludeeus].

#### {% linkable_title Upgrade scripts %}

[@Ludeeus][ludeeus] contributed the possibility to run upgrade scripts to the `hassbian-config` tool.

 - Upgrade Hassbian: Upgrades packages of the base operating system. Contributed by [@Landrash][landrash].
 - Upgrade Hassbian-script: Downloads and upgrades the latest release of Hassbian-scripts. Contributed by [@Ludeeus][ludeeus].
 - Upgrade Home-assistant: Upgrades the Home Assistant installation to the latest release. Contributed by [@Ludeeus][ludeeus].
