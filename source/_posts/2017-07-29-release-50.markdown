<a href='/components/#version/0.50'><img src='/images/blog/2017-07-0.50/components.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'></a>

Last Wednesday we released [Hass.io](/hassio/), an operating system to take care of all the updating hassles that come with running home automation at home and so much more. This is a major milestone for Home Assistant as it is our first step to offering a fully integrated solution using a bring your own hardware approach.

The launch has been crazy successful. The [20 minute introduction video][hassio-intro] by BRUHAutomation already has 12.5k views in just 4 days with no less than 150 comments.

Hass.io will be a great foundation for bigger and better integrated features. Stay tuned.

### {% linkable_title Adding the power of voice to integrations %}

But enough about Hass.io, let's not forget about Home Assistant. This release has completely revamped the way how we deal with voice integrations. We turned Home Assistant into a platform to write voice apps, no matter where the processing of the voice happens. This can be done by Alexa, Google Assistant or in the Home Assistant user interface.

We are super excited about the new functionality and hope that it will trigger a new type of applications and systems to be built on top of Home Assistant. This release includes a shopping list to show the new functionality. As a user you can add any item to the shopping list with your voice and also ask what is on your shopping list.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
shopping_list:
```

To make testing these applications easier, we've updated the conversation component. The component will now allow sentences to be configured that hook directly into the new voice functionality. Combined with the new interface it will allow for some great interactions! Check out the [developer docs][intent docs] for more information.

### {% linkable_title History improvements %}

[@OverloadUT] has been recently spending a lot of time on optimizing the history database queries. This release includes PR [#8632], the first in a list of improvements that he is working on. This PR greatly improves requests for single entities by using an optimized query for this use case.

The performance change in some of his tests shows this change to be about 300x faster (30 seconds to 0.1 seconds!) (There is no theoretical upper limit due to the issue with multi-entity queries getting worse the longer the current recorder run has been going.)

### {% linkable_title Xiaomi integration %}

Yes, it has happened! After being in beta for a while, the Xiaomi support is now available to all. [@danielhiversen] did an amazing job and we now support sensors, switches, lights and covers.

### {% linkable_title Velbus integration %}

Another awesome integration is that of the Velbus home automation system which has been contributed by [@thomasdelaet]. It integrates their sensors, covers, fans, lights and switches.

### {% linkable_title Manual alarm with MQTT control %}

A new version of the manual alarm component is now available with full MQTT control thanks to [@colinodell]. Using this you can build your own control panel to remotely arm/disarm the alarm. For example, using a [Raspberry Pi to create an alarm](https://www.hackster.io/colinodell/diy-alarm-control-panel-for-home-assistant-ac1813).

## {% linkable_title Breaking Changes %}

- Automations: The state trigger keyword `state` and the time trigger keyword `after` were deprecated in 0.46. They have now been removed. Use `to` and `at` instead. ([@amelchio] - [#8510]) ([automation.state docs]) ([automation.time docs]) (breaking change)
- Wink: the component is no longer supporting the `access_token` in the config. Use the new OAuth authentication or add your username and password to the config. ([@w1ll1am23] - [#8208]) ([wink docs]) (breaking change)
- Alexa/API.AI/Snips.ai/Conversation: configuring responses to intents/sentences has been moved to a new component called `intent_script`. Conversation now allows configuring sentences to map to intents. ([@balloob] - [#8434]) ([alexa docs]) ([intent docs]) ([intent_script docs])
 ([shopping_list docs]) ([snips docs]) (breaking change) (new-platform)
