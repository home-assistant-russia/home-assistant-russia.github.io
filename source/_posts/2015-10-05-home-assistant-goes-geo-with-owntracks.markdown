A few weeks have past and it is time again for another release: version 0.7.4. This time we're very glad to be able to introduce brand new integration with OwnTracks to allow tracking of people on a map. The geo support consists of three different parts:

 - [OwnTracks platform for the device tracker][platform-owntracks] to get locations for devices
 - Brand new [zone component][component-zone] to define zones to identify locations and [trigger automation][zone-automation]
 - A map in the UI to see all this ([see it in action in the demo](/demo/))

We have added a new [getting started section][start-presence] to get up and running.

[platform-owntracks]: /components/device_tracker.owntracks/
[component-zone]: /components/zone/
[zone-automation]: /getting-started/automation-trigger/#zone-trigger
[start-presence]: /getting-started/presence-detection/

Ofcourse more things happened in the last three weeks. I'm moving away from my usual long post to a short summary of highlights:
