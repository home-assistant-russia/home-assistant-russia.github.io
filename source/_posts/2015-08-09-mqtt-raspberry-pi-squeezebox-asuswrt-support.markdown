It's time for the August release and there is some serious good stuff this time. The core of Home Assistant has gone some serious clean up and a bump in test coverage thanks to [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob). If you're a developer, make sure you read up on [the deprecation notices](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/251). [@fabaff](https://github.com/fabaff) did another great round of documenting all the various components.

__MQTT Support__
<img src='/images/supported_brands/mqtt.png' style='border:none; box-shadow: none; float: right;' height='50' /> The big new addition in this release is the support for the MQTT protocol by [@fabaff](https://github.com/fabaff) with some help from [@balloob](https://github.com/balloob). It will now be possible to integrate any IoT device that talks via MQTT. For the initial release we support connecting Home Assistant to a broker (no TLS yet). Components can now subscribe and publish to MQTT topics ([see the example][mqtt-example]) and also support for the automation component [has been added][mqtt-automation]. For more information, see [the MQTT component page][mqtt-component].

[mqtt-example]: https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/dev/config/custom_components/mqtt_example.py
[mqtt-automation]: /getting-started/automation-trigger/#mqtt-trigger
[mqtt-component]: /components/mqtt/

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  broker: IP_ADDRESS_BROKER
  # All the other options are optional:
  port: 1883
  keepalive: 60
  qos: 0
  username: your_username
  password: your_secret_password
```

__Raspberry Pi GPIO Support__
<img src='/images/supported_brands/raspberry-pi.png' style='border:none; box-shadow: none; float: right;' height='50' /> [@gbarba](https://github.com/gbarba) has contributed support to use the general purpose input and output pins on a Raspberry Pi as switches inside Home Assistant.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
switch:
  platform: rpi_gpio
  ports:
    11: Fan Office
    12: Light Desk
```

__ASUSWRT based routers__
<img src='/images/supported_brands/asus.png' style='border:none; box-shadow: none; float: right;' height='50' /> [@persandstrom](https://github.com/persandstrom) has contributed support to do prescence detection using ASUSWRT based routers.
