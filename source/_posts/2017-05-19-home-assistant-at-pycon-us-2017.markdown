In just 12 hours PyCon US 2017 starts. This is an exciting conference because there will be a bunch of Home Assistant developers and users there being able to meet in person.

Just like last year, we'll be hosting a [Home Assistant Open Space](https://us.pycon.org/2017/events/open-spaces/). Please stop by to ask any questions you have to the available developers. ~~We haven't reserved a slot yet but will do so tomorrow. We'll update this post and announce it on social media as we know time and location.~~ **First open-space will be Friday at 4pm in room B112.**

We will also be taken part in the [development sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2017/community/sprints/) from Monday-Wednesday. You only need to bring a laptop. We'll help you get set up with a dev environment and you can be coding on top of Home Assistant in no time. ~~Exact location inside the conference center to be announced.~~ **We are sitting in room A108.**

On a final note, the Home Assistant community is very very active so don't take it personal if we don't remember your name, issue or contribution.
