Using [Keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) is an alternative way to `secrets.yaml`. The secrets can be managed from the command line via the `keyring` script.

```bash
$ hass --script keyring --help
```

To store a password in keyring, replace your password or API key with `!secret` and an identifier in `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
http:
  api_password: !secret http_password
```

Create an entry in your keyring.

```bash
$ hass --script keyring set http_password
```

If you launch Home Assistant now, you will be prompted for the keyring password to unlock your keyring.

```bash
$ hass
Config directory: /home/homeassistant/.homeassistant
Please enter password for encrypted keyring:
```

<p class='note warning'>
  If you are using the Python Keyring, [autostarting](/getting-started/autostart/) of Home Assistant will no longer work.
