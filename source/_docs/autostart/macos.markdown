Setting up Home Assistant to run as a background service is simple; macOS will start Home Assistant on boot and make sure it's always running.

To get Home Assistant installed as a background service, run:


```bash
$ hass --script macos install

Home Assistant has been installed.         Open it here: http://localhost:8123
```

Home Assistant will log to `~/Library/Logs/homeassistant.log`

To uninstall the service, run:

```bash
$ hass --script macos uninstall

Home Assistant has been uninstalled.
```
