Conditions can be used within a script or automation to prevent further execution. A condition will look at the system right now. For example a condition can test if a switch is currently turned on or off.

### {% linkable_title AND condition %}

Test multiple conditions in 1 condition statement. Passes if all embedded conditions are valid.

```yaml
condition:
  condition: and
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: 'device_tracker.paulus'
      state: 'home'
    - condition: numeric_state
      entity_id: 'sensor.temperature'
      below: '20'
```

If you do not want to combine AND and OR conditions, you can also just list them sequentially, by default all conditions have to be true. 
The following configuration works the same as the one listed above:

```yaml
condition:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: 'device_tracker.paulus'
    state: 'home'
  - condition: numeric_state
    entity_id: 'sensor.temperature'
    below: '20'
```

Currently you need to format your conditions like this to be able to edit them using the [automations editor](/docs/automation/editor/).

### {% linkable_title OR condition %}

Test multiple conditions in 1 condition statement. Passes if any embedded condition is valid.

```yaml
condition:
  condition: or
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: 'device_tracker.paulus'
      state: 'home'
    - condition: numeric_state
      entity_id: 'sensor.temperature'
      below: '20'
```

### {% linkable_title MIXED  AND and OR conditions %}

Test multiple AND and OR conditions in 1 condition statement. Passes if any embedded conditions is valid.
This allows you to mix several AND and OR conditions together.

```yaml
condition:
  condition: and
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: 'device_tracker.paulus'
      state: 'home'
    - condition: or
      conditions:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: sensor.weather_precip
          state: 'rain'
        - condition: numeric_state
          entity_id: 'sensor.temperature'
          below: '20'
```

### {% linkable_title Numeric state condition %}

This type of condition attempts to parse the state of specified entity as a number and triggers if the value matches the thresholds.

If both `below` and `above` are specified, both tests have to pass.

You can optionally use a `value_template` to process the value of the state before testing it.

```yaml
condition:
  condition: numeric_state
  entity_id: sensor.temperature
  above: 17
  below: 25
  # If your sensor value needs to be adjusted
  value_template: {% raw %}{{ float(state.state) + 2 }}{% endraw %}
```

### {% linkable_title State condition %}

Tests if an entity is a specified state.

```yaml
condition:
  condition: state
  entity_id: device_tracker.paulus
  state: not_home
  # optional: trigger only if state was this for last X time.
  for:
    hours: 1
    minutes: 10
    seconds: 5
```

### {% linkable_title Sun condition %}

The sun condition can test if the sun has already set or risen when a trigger occurs. The `before` and `after` keys can only be set to `sunset` or `sunrise`. They have a corresponding optional offset value (`before_offset`, `after_offset`) that can be added, similar to the [sun trigger][sun_trigger].

[sun_trigger]: /docs/automation/trigger/#sun-trigger

```yaml
condition:
  condition: sun
  after: sunset
  # Optional offset value - in this case it must from -1 hours relative to sunset, or after
  after_offset: "-1:00:00"
```

```yaml
condition:
    condition: or  # 'when dark' condition: either after sunset or before sunrise
    conditions:
      - condition: sun
        after: sunset
      - condition: sun
        before: sunrise
```

Here is a truth table to clarify the parameters with and without offset:

| command                            |        night | at sunrise  | daytime | at sunset  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ |:-----------:| ------- |:----------:|
| `after: sunset`                    | True         |      ⇒      | False   |     ⇒      |
| + `after_offset: "01:00:00"`       | True         |      ⇒      | False   |  **+1h**   |
| + `after_offset: "-01:00:00"`      | True         |      ⇒      | False   |  **-1h**   |
| `before: sunset`                   | False        |      ⇒      | True    |     ⇒      |
| + `before_offset: "01:00:00"`      | False        |      ⇒      | True    |  **+1h**   |
| + `before_offset: "-01:00:00"`     | False        |      ⇒      | True    |  **-1h**   |
| `after: sunrise`                   | False        |      ⇒      | True    |     ⇒      |
| + `after_offset: "01:00:00"`       | False        |   **+1h**   | True    |     ⇒      |
| + `after_offset: "-01:00:00"`      | False        |   **-1h**   | True    |     ⇒      |
| `before: sunrise`                  | True         |      ⇒      | False   |     ⇒      |
| + `before_offset: "01:00:00"`      | True         |   **+1h**   | False   |     ⇒      |
| + `before_offset: "-01:00:00"`     | True         |   **-1h**   | False   |     ⇒      |

### {% linkable_title Template condition %}

The template condition will test if the [given template][template] renders a value equal to true. This is achieved by having the template result in a true boolean expression or by having the template render 'true'.

```yaml
condition:
  condition: template
  value_template: '{% raw %}{{ states.device_tracker.iphone.attributes.battery > 50 }}{% endraw %}'
```

Within an automation, template conditions also have access to the `trigger` variable as [described here][automation-templating].

[template]: /topics/templating/
[automation-templating]: /getting-started/automation-templating/

### {% linkable_title Time condition %}

The time condition can test if it is after a specified time, before a specified time or if it is a certain day of the week

```yaml
condition:
  condition: time
  # At least one of the following is required.
  after: '15:00:00'
  before: '02:00:00'
  weekday:
    - mon
    - wed
    - fri
```

Valid values for `weekday` are `mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, `sat`, `sun`.
Time condition windows can span across the midnight threshold. In the example above, the condition window is from 3pm to 2am.

### {% linkable_title Zone condition %}

Zone conditions test if an entity is in a certain zone. For zone automation to work, you need to have setup a device tracker platform that supports reporting GPS coordinates. Currently this is limited to the [OwnTracks platform](/components/device_tracker.owntracks/) and the [iCloud platform](/components/device_tracker.icloud/).

```yaml
condition:
  condition: zone
  entity_id: device_tracker.paulus
  zone: zone.home
```

### {% linkable_title Examples %}

```yaml
    condition:
      - condition: numeric_state
        entity_id: sun.sun
        value_template: '{{ state.attributes.elevation }}'
        below: 1
      - condition: state
        entity_id: light.living_room
        state: 'off'
      - condition: time
        before: '23:00:00'
        after: '14:00:00'
      - condition: state
        entity_id: script.light_turned_off_5min
        state: 'off'
```
