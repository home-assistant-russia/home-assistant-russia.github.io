[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution. There are official packages optimized for the i686 and x86-64 architectures available.

Install the needed Python packages.

```bash
$ sudo pacman -S python
$ sudo pacman -S python-pip
```

and Home Assistant itself.

```bash
$ pip3 install --user homeassistant
```

Home Assistant is part of the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/home-assistant/). This means that it can be installed with `pacaur`. This package is often broken or outdated:

```bash
$ pacaur -S home-assistant
```
