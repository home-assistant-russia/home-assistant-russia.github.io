One of the easiest ways to install Home Assistant on your Raspberry Pi Zero, 2 ,3 and 3B+ is by using Hassbian: a Raspberry Pi image with Home Assistant built-in. The image will install the latest version of Home Assistant on initial boot (~10 minutes).

 1. [Download the Hassbian image][image-download]
 2. Use [Etcher][etcher] to flash the image to your SD card
 3. Ensure your Raspberry Pi has wired access to the internet for the entire process or configure your [wireless network settings](#wireless-network) **before proceeding to step 4**.
 4. Insert SD card to Raspberry Pi and turn it on. Initial installation of Home Assistant will take about 10 minutes.

<p class='note'>
Please remember to ensure you're using an [appropriate power supply](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#powerReqs) with your Pi. Mobile chargers may not be suitable, since some are designed to only provide the full power with that manufacturer's handsets.

These instructions are also available as a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIz6XqDwHEk).  
Additional information is available in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCGlQSsQ-Mc).

After initial boot an installer will run in the background, this will download and install the newest version of [hassbian-config](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassbian-scripts) and Home-Assistant, this takes around 10 minutes to complete, after it has finished, you will be prompted to login: `hassbian login:`. Installation is complete at this point. The default username is `pi` and the password is `raspberry`.

Open a browser on a device that's connected to the same network as your Raspberry Pi and point it to Home Assistant at [http://hassbian.local:8123]. If you want to login via SSH, the default username is `pi` and password is `raspberry` (please change this by running `passwd`). The Home Assistant configuration is located at `/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/`.

If you find that the web page is not reachable after 30 minutes or so, check that you have files in `/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/`, if there are no files in this location then run the installer manually using this command: `sudo systemctl start install_homeassistant.service`.


The following extras are included on the image:

 - GPIO pins are ready to use.
 - Bluetooth is ready to use (supported models only, no Bluetooth LE).
 - SSH server is enabled.
 - A tool called [`hassbian-config`](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassbian-scripts#hassbian-scripts). 

### {% linkable_title Wireless Network %}

After flashing the image to your SD Card open the partition `boot` and create a new file `wpa_supplicant.conf`. Edit the file and enter your network credentials. For more information visit [Setting up Wifi for Raspbian][wifi-setup]. During start the file will automatically be copied in the right folder and the network connection will be established. The file could look like this:

```conf
country=SE
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="YOUR_SSID"
    psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```
You may need to adjust the country code depending upon where you are. A list of codes can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements).

### {% linkable_title Technical Details %}

 - Home Assistant is installed in a virtual Python environment at `/srv/homeassistant/`
 - Home Assistant will be started as a service run by the user `homeassistant`
 - The configuration is located at `/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant`
