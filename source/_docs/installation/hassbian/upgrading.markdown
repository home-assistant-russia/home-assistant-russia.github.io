Hassbian is based on Raspbian and uses the same repositories. Any changes to Raspbian will be reflected in Hassbian. To update and upgrade system packages and installed software (excluding Home Assistant) do the following.
Log in as the `pi` account and execute the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```

<p class='note'>
You can use `hassbian-config` to automate the process by running `sudo hassbian-config upgrade homeassistant`
</p>

To update the Home Assistant installation execute the following command as the `pi` user.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop home-assistant@homeassistant.service
$ sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
$ source /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate
$ pip3 install --upgrade homeassistant
$ exit
$ sudo systemctl start home-assistant@homeassistant.service
```
