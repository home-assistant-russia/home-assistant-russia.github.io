By default, all of your devices will be visible and have a default icon determined by their domain. You can customize the look and feel of your front page by altering some of these parameters. This can be done by overriding attributes of specific entities.

<p class='note'>
If you implement `customize`, `customize_domain`, or `customize_glob` you must make sure it is done inside of `homeassistant:` or it will fail.
</p>

```yaml
homeassistant:
  name: Home
  unit_system: metric
  # etc

  customize:
    # Add an entry for each entity that you want to overwrite.
    sensor.living_room_motion:
      hidden: true
    thermostat.family_room:
      entity_picture: https://example.com/images/nest.jpg
      friendly_name: Nest
    switch.wemo_switch_1:
      friendly_name: Toaster
      entity_picture: /local/toaster.jpg
    switch.wemo_switch_2:
      friendly_name: Kitchen kettle
      icon: mdi:kettle
    switch.rfxtrx_switch:
      assumed_state: false
  # Customize all entities in a domain
  customize_domain:
    light:
      icon: mdi:home
    automation:
      initial_state: 'on'
  # Customize entities matching a pattern
  customize_glob:
    "light.kitchen_*":
      icon: mdi:description
    "scene.month_*_colors":
      hidden: true
      emulated_hue_hidden: false
      homebridge_hidden: true
```

### {% linkable_title Possible values %}

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `friendly_name` | Name of the entity.
| `homebridge_name` | Name of the entity in `HomeBridge`.
| `hidden`    | Set to `true` to hide the entity.
| `homebridge_hidden` | Set to `true` to hide the entity from `HomeBridge`.

| `entity_picture` | Url to use as picture for entity.

| `assumed_state` | For switches with an assumed state two buttons are shown (turn off, turn on) instead of a switch. By setting `assumed_state` to `false` you will get the default switch icon.
| `device_class` | Sets the class of the device, changing the device state and icon that is displayed on the UI (see below).
| `initial_state` | Sets the initial state for automations. `on` or `off`.
| `unit_of_measurement` | Defines the units of measurement, if any.

### {% linkable_title Device Class %}

Device class is currently supported by the following platforms:

* [Binary Sensor](/components/binary_sensor/)
* [Cover](/components/cover/)

### {% linkable_title Reloading customize %}

Home Assistant offers a service to reload the core configuration while Home Assistant is running called `homeassistant.reload_core_config`. This allows you to change your customize section and see it being applied without having to restart Home Assistant. To call this service, go to the <img src='/images/screenshots/developer-tool-services-icon.png' alt='service developer tool icon' class="no-shadow" height="38" /> service developer tools, select the service `homeassistant.reload_core_config` and click "CALL SERVICE".

<p class='note warning'>
New customize information will be applied the next time the state of the entity gets updated.
