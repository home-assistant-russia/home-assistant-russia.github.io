It was only a matter of time until the first queries for tools like [https://www.shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Home+Assistant) to search for Home Assistant instances showed up.

To get an idea about how your Home Assistant instance looks to a network scanner, you can use `nmap`. The `nmap` tool is already available if you are using the [nmap device tracker](/components/device_tracker/). 

```bash
$ nmap -sV -p 8123 --script=http-title,http-headers 192.168.1.3
