### {% linkable_title Upgrading %}

Hass.io users can update Home Assistant via the 'Hass.io' page in the UI. However please note that Home Assistant updates take time to roll into the Hass.io builds. Therefore there is often a slight delay between the availability of a Home Assistant update and an update being available in Hass.io, be patient. When a Hass.io update is available, it will be shown as available on the â€˜Hass.io' page in your UI.
