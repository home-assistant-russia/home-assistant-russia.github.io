Setting up an [SSH](https://openssh.org/) server allows access to your Hass.io folders with any SSH client. It also includes a command-line tool to access the [Hass.io API](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio/blob/dev/API.md). Try it out:

```bash
hassio help
```

<p class='note'>
This add-on will not enable you to install packages or do anything as root. This is not allowed with Hass.io.
</p>

To use this add-on, you must have a private/public key to log in. To generate them, follow the [instructions for Windows][win] and [these for other platforms][other]. It is possible to set a password for login since version 2.0 but for high security use private/public keys. You can not run both variants at the same time.

To start this add-on for the first time, you either need to include an ssh key (enclosed in quotation marks, on a single line without line breaks) or set a password in the options section. 

```json
{
  "authorized_keys": [
    "ssh-rsa AKDJD3839...== my-key"
  ],
  "password": ""
}
```

The username for login over ssh is `root`. The complete login command is `ssh root@hassio.local`.

After logging in, you will find yourself in this add-ons container. The Home Assistant configuration directory is mounted on the path `/config`.

Configuration variables:

- **authorized_keys** (*Optional*): Your public keys for the authorized key file. Every element will be a line inside that file.
- **password** (*Optional*): Set a password for login. We do not recommend this variant.

<p class='note'>This add-on is not compatible if Hass.io was installed via the generic Linux installer.</p>
