Set up a [HomeMatic](https://github.com/eq-3/occu) hardware layer. At the moment we don't support hmIP, but that is in progress. For learning and handling devices use our internal HomeMatic panel and services (in progress) or use [Homematic-Manager](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/homematic-manager) > 2.0.

The logic layer will be Home-Assistant. There is no ReGa or other logic layer installed. You can't import an existing configuration, you'll need re-learn it into Home-Assistant.

Follow devices will be supported and tested:
- [HM-MOD-RPI-PCB](https://www.elv.ch/homematic-funkmodul-fuer-raspberry-pi-bausatz.html)

```json
{
  "rf_enable": true,
  "rf": [
    {
      "type": "CCU2",
      "device": "/dev/ttyAMA0"
    }
  ],
  "wired_enable": false,
  "wired": [
    {
      "serial": "xy",
      "key": "abc",
      "ip": "192.168.0.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

Configuration variables:

- **rf_enable** (*Require*): Boolean. Enable or disable BidCoS-RF.
- **wired_enable** (*Require*): Boolean. Enable or disable BidCoS-Wired.

For RF devices
- **type** (*Require*): Device type for RFD service. Look into the manual of your device.
- **device** (*Require*): Device on the host.

For RF devices
- **serial** (*Require*): Serial number of the device.
- **key** (*Require*): Encrypted key.
- **ip** (*Require*): IP address of LAN gateway.

## {% linkable_title Home Assistant configuration %}

Use the following configuration in Home Assistant to use it:

```yaml
homematic:
  interfaces:
    rf:
      host: core-homematic
      port: 2001
```

## {% linkable_title Raspberry Pi3 %}

With HM-MOD-PRI-PCB you need to add follow into your `config.txt` on boot partition:
```
dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt
```
