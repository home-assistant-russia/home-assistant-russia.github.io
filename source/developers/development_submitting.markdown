Submit your improvements, fixes, and new features to Home Assistant one at a time, using GitHub [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Here are the steps:

 1. From your fork's dev branch, create a new branch to hold your changes:
 
      `git checkout -b some-feature`
    
 2. Make your changes, create a [new platform](/developers/add_new_platform/), develop a [new component](/developers/creating_components/), or fix [issues](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues).
 
 3. [Test your changes](/developers/development_testing/) and check for style violations.
 
 4. If everything looks good according to these [musts](/developers/development_checklist/), commit your changes:
 
    `git add .`
    
    `git commit -m "Added some-feature"`

     * Write a meaningful commit message and not only `Update` or `Fix`.
     * Use a capital letter to start with your commit message.
     * Don't prefix your commit message with `[bla.bla]` or `platform:`.
     * Consider adding tests to ensure that your code works.
   
 5. Push your committed changes back to your fork on GitHub:
 
    `git push origin HEAD`
 
 6. Follow [these steps](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to create your pull request.
 
     * On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the Home Assistant repository.
     * In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits (from your fork).
     * To the right of the Branch menu, click **New pull request**.
     * Use the base branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in. Make sure the Home Assistant branch matches with your forked branch (`dev`) else you will propose ALL commits between branches.
     * Type a title and complete the provided description for your pull request. 
     * Click **Create pull request**.
 
 7. Check for comments and suggestions on your pull request and keep an eye on the [CI output](https://travis-ci.org/home-assistant/home-assistant/).
