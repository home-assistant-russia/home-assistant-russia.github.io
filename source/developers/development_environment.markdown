You'll need to set up a development environment if you want to develop a new feature or component for Home Assistant. Read on to learn how to set up.

### {% linkable_title Preparing your environment %}

#### {% linkable_title Developing on Linux %}

Install the core dependencies.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev python3-venv
```

In order to run `script/setup` below you will need some more dependencies.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg-dev libffi-dev libudev-dev zlib1g-dev
```

<p class='note'>
Different distributions have different package installation mechanisms and sometimes packages names as well. For example Centos would use: `sudo yum install epel-release && sudo yum install python34 python34-devel mysql-devel`
</p>

Additional dependencies exist if you plan to perform Frontend Development, please read the [Frontend](/developers/frontend/) section to learn more.

#### {% linkable_title Developing on Windows %}

If you are using Windows as a development platform, make sure that you have the correct Microsoft [Visual C++ build tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) installed. The installation of the most requirements and validation using `tox` will fail if this is not done correctly. Check the [Windows Compilers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers) section on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/) for details.

Due to Home Assistant is mainly designed and developed on Linux distributions it is not recommended to develop on Windows machines. However on Windows 10 machines you should decide to set up a [Linux subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/install-win10).

Setup Linux subsystem.

```bash
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get upgrade
$ echo 'export DISPLAY=:0' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
$ sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop -y
```

It is recommended using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) as debugger. Download and start PyCharm.

```bash
$ wget https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-20XX.X.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf pycharm-community-20XX.X
$ ./pycharm.sh
```

In order to display the PyCharm GUI on Windows you need to run a X-Server like [VcXserv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).

Also, make sure to install or upgrade the `setuptools` Python package. It contains compatibility improvements and adds automatic use of compilers:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade setuptools
```

#### {% linkable_title Developing on OS X %}

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then use that to install Python 3:

```bash
$ brew install python3
```

### {% linkable_title Setup Local Repository %}

Visit the [Home Assistant repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) and click **Fork**.
Once forked, setup your local copy of the source using the commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GIT_USERNAME/home-assistant.git
$ cd home-assistant
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.git
```

### {% linkable_title Setting up virtual environment %}

To isolate your environment from the rest of the system, set up a [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Within the `home-assistant` directory, create and activate your virtual environment.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .
$ source bin/activate
```
Install the requirements with a provided script named `setup`.

```bash
$ script/setup
```

Invoke your installation.

```bash
$ hass
```

### {% linkable_title Logging %}

By default logging in home-assistant is tuned for operating in production (set to INFO by default, with some modules set to even less verbose logging levels).

You can use the [logger](/components/logger/) component to adjust logging to DEBUG to see even more details about what is going on.
