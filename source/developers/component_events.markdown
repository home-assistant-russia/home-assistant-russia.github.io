Home Assistant has different ways of responding to events that occur in Home Assistant. These have been organized in [helper methods](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/dev/homeassistant/helpers/event.py). Examples are `track_state_change`, `track_point_in_time`, `track_time_change`.
