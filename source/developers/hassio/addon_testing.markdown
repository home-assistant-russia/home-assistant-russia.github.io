The fastest way to develop add-ons is by adding them to your local add-on repository. To access your local add-on repository, install either the [Samba add-on] or [SSH add-on].

Right now add-ons will work with images that are stored on Docker Hub (using `image` from add-on config). Without `image` inside local add-ons repository it to be built on the device.

## {% linkable_title Local build %}

You can build and try the addon on your developer machine also. Move all addon stuff into a temp folder. If you use `FROM $BUILD_FROM` you need set a base image with build args. Normally you can use follow base images:

- armhf: `homeassistant/armhf-base:latest`
- aarch64: `homeassistant/aarch64-base:latest`
- amd64: `homeassistant/amd64-base:latest`
- i386: `homeassistant/i386-base:latest`

Use `docker` to build the test addon: `docker build --build-arg BUILD_FROM="homeassistant/amd64-base:latest" -t local/my-test-addon .`

## {% linkable_title Local run %}

Create a new folder for data and add a test _options.json_ file. After that you can run your add-on with: `docker run --rm -v /tmp/my_test_data:/data -p PORT_STUFF_IF_NEEDED local/my-test-addon`

## {% linkable_title Logs %}

All stdout and stderr are redirected to the Docker logs. The logs can be fetched from the add-on page inside the Hass.io panel in Home Assistant.
